# Viewing user list and details

With the user management dashboard you can view the list of users and their details. You can also perform different operations on theses users as mentioned below.

## Viewing users list

If you have just created your app, you may not have any users to show on the dashboard.

Navigate to the your frontend app and create a user (via the sign up flow). On creation, if you head back to the dashboard and refresh the page, you will see that user:

## User details page

When you select a user you can view detailed information about the user such as email, phone number, user metadata etc.

<img src="/img/dashboard/user-info.png" alt="User details page screen UI part one" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/user-info-continued.png" alt="User details page screen UI part two" />

You can edit user information and perform actions such as resetting a user's password or revoke sessions for a user.

:::important Note
Some features such as user metadata and email verification have to be enabled in your backend before you can use them in the user management dashboard
