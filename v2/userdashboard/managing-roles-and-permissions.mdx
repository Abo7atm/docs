# Managing roles and permissions

You can manage <a href="/docs/userroles/introduction" target="_blank">user roles and permissions</a> of your app from the user management dashboard. Which will provide you with all the necessary operations like creating, updating and assigning a role to a user.

Inorder to get started with the user roles and permissions on user management dashboard you need to first initialise the UserRoles recipe in the `recipeList`.

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-node";
import Dashboard from "supertokens-node/recipe/dashboard";
import UserRoles from "supertokens-node/recipt/userroles"

SuperTokens.init({
  appInfo: {
    apiDomain: "...",
    appName: "...",
    websiteDomain: "...",
  },
  recipeList: [
    // TODO: Initialise other recipes if needed.
    Dashboard.init(),
    // highlight-start
    UserRoles.init()
    // highlight-end
  ],
});
```
:::important Note
Managing roles and permissions from the user management dashboard is only available from node sdk `v16.6.0`.

    app_info=InputAppInfo(

When you use `UserRoles` recipe for the first time you will not be having any roles created for your app. So you need to first create some roles to use by clicking on the add role button.

That will open up a modal which will allow you to create a role with required name and permissions.

<img src="/img/dashboard/create-role.png" alt="Create role"/>

Once after the successfull creation of a role you can see it in the roles list.

<img src="/img/dashboard/roles-list.png" alt="Roles list"/>

Now you can preview the role that you have created by clicking on the role row in roles list table and you can also delete a role if it's not created intentionally or something.

<img src="/img/dashboard/preview-role.png" alt="Preview role"/>

You can also remove or add new permissions to a existing role by clicking on the edit button after the creation of the role although it's worth keeping in mind that you cannot change the roles name once it's created.

<img src="/img/dashboard/edit-role.png" alt="Edit role"/>

Inorder to assign a particular role to a user you need to first find the user from the dashboard and in the user details page of that particular user you can see the user roles section as you can see in the below image.

If the selected user is part of multiple tenants then you can select a `tenantId` from the dropdown in which you want to assign required roles. And if the user is not part of multiple tenants then the role is assigned to the default selected tenant.

<img src="/img/dashboard/select-tenant.png" alt="Select tenant"/>

Click on the edit button to get started with assigning roles and then click on Assign Role button which open's up a modal that lists all the roles that are avaliable to assign to this user.

To assign a particular role you can click on the plus icon button on the role and then the UI will promt you for confirmation after confirmation the selected role is assigned to the user.


<img src="/img/dashboard/assign-role.png" alt="Assign role"/>

Once you have assigned the roles that you need to assign to a user you can close the modal and you can see that the added roles are now listed on the assigned user roles section as you can see in the below image.

You can remove the role assigned to a user by clicking on the cross icon on a particular role and the UI will prompt you to confirm the removal and after the confirmation the role will be removed from the user.
