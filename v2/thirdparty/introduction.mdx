Before going into the actual tutorial, let's get a clear picture of how SuperTokens works and some of the terms that we will use throughout the next pages.

## SuperTokens Core

The main service that provides all the functionality is called the **SuperTokens Core**. SDKs communicate over an API with this service in order to 
perform authentication related tasks.

Unlike other authentication providers, the frontend never talks to the **SuperTokens Core** directly. All requests target your existing backend service. With the use of our backend SDKs new authentication routes get exposed which in turn will communicate with the **SuperTokens Core**.

The following diagram shows a high level overview of how your services will interact within an authentication setup that involves **SuperTokens**.

:::info Edge Cases
- You can also host the **SuperTokens Core** yourself. In that case your backend will communicate with a service that exists inside your infrastructure.
- If you are using a backend for which we do not have an SDK, you will have to spin up an additional auth service in a language for which we do have a backend SDK (NodeJS, Python or Golang).

For a more detailed explanation of how everything works please check the [how SuperTokens works section](./architecture).


## Recipes

The functionalities that **SuperTokens** provides are bundled into objects that can be reffered to as **Recipes**.
Everything from *authentication methods* to *session and user management* can be included under this concept.
In the following sections, we will see how recipes get initialised and configured and how you can customise them to fit your use case.


## Next steps

In the next sections we will guide you through how you can add SuperTokens to your existing application.

If you want to see a quick example of the functionalities you can alawys use our example apps. 
Just run the following command in order to install everything on your local machine.


```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest --recipe=emailpassword
```
