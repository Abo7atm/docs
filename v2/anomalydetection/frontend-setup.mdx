# Setting up the Frontend

Setting up the frontend is relatively simple. You need to generate a request ID for each authentication event attempt. 

:::important
This frontend setup is required only for bot detection and anomaly IP based detection such as impossible travel detection. We also recommend checking for bot detection only on the email password login flows. 
:::

### Generating a Request ID on the Frontend

In order to generate a request ID, you need to import and initialise the SDK using your public API key. This SDK is used to generate a unique request ID for each authentication event attempt.

:::important
When calling the `get` function of the SDK, you need to pass the `environmentId` as a tag. This is used to identify the environment in which the request ID is being generated.
:::

Below is an example of how to implement request ID generation on your frontend:


```tsx
const API_KEY = "<api-key>"; // Your public API key that you received from the SuperTokens team
const SDK_URL = "https://supertokens.io/JfNbWqtXUiGYuTqb/PYmK3PIPqdvHw6iz";
const ENVIRONMENT_ID = "<environment-id>"; // Your environment ID that you received from the SuperTokens team

const supertokensAnomalyDetectionSdkPromise = import(SDK_URL + "?apiKey=" + API_KEY).then((RequestId: any) => RequestId.load({
    endpoint: [
        SDK_URL,
        RequestId.defaultEndpoint
    ]
}));

async function getRequestId() {
    const sdk = await supertokensAnomalyDetectionSdkPromise;
    const result = await sdk.get({
        tag: {
            environmentId: ENVIRONMENT_ID,
        }
    });
    return result.requestId;
}
```

### Passing the Request ID to the Backend

Once you have generated the request ID on the frontend, you need to pass it to the backend. This is done by including the `requestId` property along with the value as part of the preAPIHook body from the initialisation of the recipes.

:::important
If the request ID is not passed to the backend, the anomaly detection will only be able to detect password breaches and brute force attacks.
:::

Below is a full example of how to configure the SDK and pass the request ID to the backend:
```tsx
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";

const API_KEY = "<api-key>"; // Your public API key that you received from the SuperTokens team
const SDK_URL = "https://supertokens.io/JfNbWqtXUiGYuTqb/PYmK3PIPqdvHw6iz";
const ENVIRONMENT_ID = "<environment-id>"; // Your environment ID that you received from the SuperTokens team

const supertokensRequestIdPromise = import(SDK_URL + "?apiKey=" + API_KEY).then((RequestId: any) => RequestId.load({
    endpoint: [
        SDK_URL,
        RequestId.defaultEndpoint
    ]
}));

async function getRequestId() {
    const requestId = await supertokensRequestIdPromise;
    const result = await requestId.get({
        tag: {
            environmentId: ENVIRONMENT_ID,
        }
    });
    return result.requestId;
}

export const SuperTokensConfig = {
    // ... other config options
    appInfo: {
        appName: "...",
        apiDomain: '...',
        websiteDomain: '...',
    },
    // recipeList contains all the modules that you want to
    // use from SuperTokens. See the full list here: https://supertokens.com/docs/guides
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init({
            // highlight-start
            preAPIHook: async (context) => {
                let url = context.url;
                let requestInit = context.requestInit;

                let action = context.action;
                if (action === "EMAIL_PASSWORD_SIGN_IN" || action === "EMAIL_PASSWORD_SIGN_UP" || action === "SEND_RESET_PASSWORD_EMAIL") {
                    let requestId = await getRequestId();
                    let body = context.requestInit.body;
                    if (body !== undefined) {
                        let bodyJson = JSON.parse(body as string);
                        bodyJson.requestId = requestId;
                        requestInit.body = JSON.stringify(bodyJson);
                    }
                }
                return {
                    requestInit, url
                };
            }
            // highlight-end
        }),
    ],
};
```
