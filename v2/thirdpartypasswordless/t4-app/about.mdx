# T4 App integration with SuperTokens

To integrate SuperTokens with [the T4 App starter kit](https://t4stack.com/), use this [boilerplate](https://github.com/timothymiller/t4-app/tree/supertokens-auth). This repository uses [supertokens-web-js](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-web-js) for unified authentication logic across Next.js and Expo applications.  It comes preconfigured with "Email Password + Social" login recipes and is easily extensible to accommodate additional recipes.
