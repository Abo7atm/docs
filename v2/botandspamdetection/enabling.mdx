# Enabling the feature

This feature is **currently in beta**. In order to get access to this feature, please reach out to us at team@supertokens.com to get it setup for you. 

Once you have access to the feature, you will receive from us:
- **Public API key** - this will be used on your frontend for generating request IDs
- **Secret API key** - this will be used on your backend for making requests to our anomaly detection API
- **Environment ID** - this will be used for identifying the environment you are using both on the backend and the frontend
