The **SuperTokens SDK** exposes a separate dashboard that you can use to manage your users.

<GuideCondition match={guide => guide.backend !== "nextjs"}>

In order to access it you will have to go to `<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>/auth/dashboard`. 

</GuideCondition>

<GuideCondition match={guide => guide.backend === "nextjs"}>

In order to access it you will have to go to `<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>/api/auth/dashboard`. 

</GuideCondition>

Once the dashboard login page has loaded, click on the **Add New User** button and follow the next steps in order to create a user.
For a more detailed overview on each step of the process please check our separate [page](/docs/userdashboard/about).

After you have logged in, you can view the users that have authenticated in to your app, check their login attempts and manage roles and permissions straight from the dashboard interface.
