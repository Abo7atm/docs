On the frontend side there we need to figure out which tenant we are trying to log in, a process known as *Tenant Discovery*.
There are two common approaches to this:
- Using the sub domain as a identifier for a tenant. 
- Asking the user to enter a tenant ID (or any other identifier using which you can derive the tenant ID). 

Any which way, once we have a way to get the tenant ID, we need to return that in the `getTenantId` callback in the `multitenancy.init` config on the frontend.
In our example app, we ask the user to select their tenant from a dropdown before they try and login. 
Once the user has selected that, we store the in localstorage, and return it from the `getTenantId` function when it's called by our SDK.

After the tenant ID is selected we proceed to show the actual login UI in order to complete the authentication flow.
