In the case of **multi-factor authentication** the MFA claim needs to also be verified, i.e., we need to check that the MFA claim in the access token indicates that the user has completed all required factors. 
This is done by our backend SDK's session verification automatically. In case you want to exclude certain routes from the claim check or you want to perform this step manually
check the [extensive docs](/docs/mfa/protect-routes#protecting-api-routes) on how to do this.
