Before we talk about the configuration details of this recipe let's first go through some of the main concepts of multi-factor authentication:
- **Factors** are the different ways in which a user can authenticate. For example, `"emailpassword"`, or `"thirdparty"`, or `"totp"`.
- **Session claims** are key-value pairs that are included JSON payload of the user's session's access token, which tell us about the state of their identity. In the MFA context, the access token payload will contain information about which factors have been completed by the user so far.
  - **Account Linking** is the process of connecting multiple authentication methods to a single user account. Since MFA requires multiple login challenges, account linking will make sure that all the login challenges configured by the user will be saved to one account. For example, if you have email password as the first factor, followed by phone OTP, account linking will make sure to save the email and the phone against the same primary user ID.
