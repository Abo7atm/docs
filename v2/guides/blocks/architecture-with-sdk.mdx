You can directly integrate SuperTokens in your existing services. The authentication routes will be properly exposed based on your configuration.

There are three main components that you need to keep in mind here:
- The **Frontend SDK** - Provides pre built UI components and functions to manage authentication from your frontend app.
- The **Backend SDK** - Comunicates with the **Core Service** and exposes all the auth related APIs for your frontend to call. It also enables session management and access control for your application.
- The **SuperTokens Core Service** - This is where we persist the state of the authentication functionalities. The service gets called by the backend SDK throughout every exposed feature. You can choose between self hosting the **SuperTokens Core Service** or using our managed offering.
