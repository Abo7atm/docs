You can copy paste the account linking configuration into your backend config. For more details on how to customize the **Account Linking** behavior please check our [separate page](/docs/mfa/backend-setup#step-1-enable-account-linking).

The `MultiFactorAuth` recipe is configured to use `thirdparty` (social login) and `emailpassword` as the first authentication **factors**. For the second factor, we will present a choice of `TOTP` (Time-based One-time Password) or Email / Phone `OTP` (One-time password) to the user on sign up.
On the `frontend` we only need to configure the first factors in the recipe initialization process.

Given this setup the authentication flow will work in the following way:
1. The user will see a form where they can either login using a social account or through email and password
2. If the attempt is successful, the user will be directed towards a factor choser screen. Here they can choose between `TOTP` and `OTP`.
3. Based on their selection, we will show the appropriate UI for the factor they chose.

Use the following [page](/docs/mfa/backend-setup#single-tenant-setup) to adjust the configuration based on your needs.
