import { GuideRecipeLink } from "/src/components/guides/GuideRecipeLink"

##### `config.ts`

Here we configure the **SuperTokens SDK** and the features that your instance will use.
There are two functions exported by this file:
- `initSuperTokensWebJS`: Initializes the `supertokens-web-js` SDK which exposes session management related functions to your components. 
- `initSuperTokensNodeJS`: Initializes the prebuilt UI bundle that will be used to render the authentication pages.

You will have to update the `appInfo` sections based on your existing app setup. 
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication <GuideRecipeLink link="architecture#what-is-a-recipe">recipe</GuideRecipeLink>. But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `/views/AuthView.vue`

The authentication UI gets initialized and rendered by this component.
In the `loadScript` function, we provide the SuperTokens config for the UI.

##### `/router/index.ts`

In here we update the Vue router so that all the auth related requests load the `AuthView` component.

##### `/views/HomeView.vue`

Check this file for examples on how to work with authentication session data.

##### `/main.ts`

We initialize the **SuperTokens SDK** at the root of the application. This way we make sure that we have everything ready  
once the entire javascript bundle finishes loading.
