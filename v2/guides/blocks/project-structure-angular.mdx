import { GuideRecipeLink } from "/src/components/guides/GuideRecipeLink"

##### `config.ts`

Here we configure the **SuperTokens SDK** and the features that your instance will use.
There are two functions exported by this file:
- `initSuperTokensWebJS`: Initializes the `supertokens-web-js` SDK which exposes session management related functions to your components. 
- `initSuperTokensNodeJS`: Initializes the prebuilt UI bundle that will be used to render the authentication pages.

You will have to update the `appInfo` sections based on your existing app setup. 
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication <GuideRecipeLink link="architecture#what-is-a-recipe">recipe</GuideRecipeLink>. But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `app/auth`

This folder can be copy and pasted directly into your existing project without any additional changes.
It initializes the UI code and configures the routes that will be used to authenticate your users.

##### `app/app-routing.module.ts`

An example of how to integrate the authentication router into your main app router.

##### `app/app.component.ts`

We initialize the **SuperTokens SDK** at the root of the application. This way we make sure that we have everything ready  
once the entire javascript bundle finishes loading.

##### `home/home.component.ts`

In this file you will find examples on how to work with session specific data, like user details.
