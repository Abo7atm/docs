The example app includes all the supported third party providers in the config files.
Just remove the ones that you do not want to use.

You will also have to update the credentials for each provider. For more details on how to do this check our [extensive instructions](/docs/thirdparty/pre-built-ui/setup/backend#3-initialise-social-login-providers).

<GuideCondition match={guide => guide.authMethod === "multi-tenant"}>

The example app only initialises the `ThirdParty` recipe in the backend config.

Actual credentials for each login provider need to be added during the tenant creation process.
Check out this [page](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/common-customizations/multi-tenancy/new-tenant-config) for more info.
