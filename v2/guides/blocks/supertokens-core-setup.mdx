In our example app we used [try.supertokens.com](https://try.supertokens.com) to host the example app. You can replace the endpoint with your the correct one based on your configuration.

If you want to use our managed service, check this [guide](/docs/community/supertokens-core/saas-setup) on how to sign up and create your environment. 
Otherwise, for self-hosted instances, you can follow either the [Docker](/docs/community/supertokens-core/self-hosted/with-docker) guide or the other [instructions](/docs/community/supertokens-core/self-hosted/without-docker), for non-docker scenarios.
