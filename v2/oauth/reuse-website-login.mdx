# Reuse website login for desktop and mobile apps

This pattern is useful if you want to have the same web authentication experience for your desktop and mobile apps.
The flow will allow you to save develpoment time but you will have to keep in mind that it will not involve a native authentication interface.
Users will be directed to a separate browser page where they will complete the authentication flow.

<img src="/img/oauth/reuse-web-ui-for-mobile.png" alt="Reuse website login for desktop and mobile apps"/>

The authentication flow will work in the following way:

1. User accesses the native application
2. The user gets redirected to [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) authentication url.
3. The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) redirects the user to the login UI
4. User completes the login attempt 
5. The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) backend redirects the user to the `callback URL`.
This URL should be a deep link that can be opened by your actual application.
6. The application uses the callback URL information to request a **OAuth2 Access Token** from the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service).
7. The returned token is saved by the application.

:::info
This guide assumes that you already have setup and configured **SuperTokens** in your [**Authentication Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authentication-service). 

For more information on how to do that please check our [quickstart guides](/docs/guides).

## 1. Enable the OAuth2 features from the Dashboard

You will first have to enable the **OAuth2** features from the **SuperTokens Dashboard**.
1. Open the **SuperTokens Dashboard**
2. Click on the **Enabled Paid Features** button
3. Click on **Managed Service**
4. Check the **OAuth 2.0** option
5. Click *Save* 

Now you should be able to use the OAuth2 recipes in your applications.

<!-- END COPY SECTION -->


## 2. Create the OAuth2 Clients

<CoreInjector defaultValue="https://<your-core-identifier>.aws.supertokens.io" showTenantId={false}>

<AppInfoForm
    askForAppName
    askForAPIDomain
    askForWebsiteDomain
>

For each of your **`applications`** you will have to create a separate [**OAuth2 Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client).
This can be done by directly calling the **SuperTokens Core** API.


```bash
# You will have to run this for each one of your applications
# Adjust the client_name and redirect_uri based on that
curl -X POST ^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/oauth2/admin/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: ^{coreInjector_api_key_without_quotes}" \
  -d '{
      "client_name": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
      "response_types": ["code", "id_token"],
      "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
      "tokenEndpointAuthMethod": "none",
      "redirect_uri": ["https://<YOUR_APPLICATION_DOMAIN>/oauth/callback"]
    }'
```

- `client_name` - A human-readable name of the client that will be used for identification.
- `response_types` - Specifies the types of responses your client expects from the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-server). Most of the time, you would need the following two to be present:
    - `code`: Indicates that the [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) will receive an **Authorization Code** that will be exchanged for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
    - `id_token`: Indicates that the [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) expects an [**ID Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#id-token)
- `grant_types` - The grant types that the [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) will use. 
    - `authorization_code`: Allows exchanging the **Authorization Code** for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
    - `refresh_token`: Allows exchanging the [**OAuth2 Refresh Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-refresh-token) for a new [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
- `redirect_uri` - A list of URIs to which the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-server) will send the user-agent (browser) after completing the authorization step. These can be deep links to mobile or desktop apps as well, but they must be exact URLs, without wildcards.

If the creation was successful, the API will return a response that looks like this:

```json

{
    "client_name": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
    "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "callback_urls": ["https://<YOUR_APPLICATION_DOMAIN>/oauth/callback"],
}

```

Based on the client creation process we can also infer two additional values that we will need later on:
- `authorize_url` corresponds to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}oauth/auth`
- `token_fetch_url` corresponds to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}oauth/token`

:::caution

You will have to save this response because we do not persist it internally for security reasons.
In the next steps we will use the values to complete several configurations.

:::

## 3. Make sure that you have properly configured the Authorization Service

If you have not set up the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) yet, please check one of the previous guides based whether you use multiple backend service:
- [Multiple Backends Setup](/docs/oauth/multiple-frontends-with-separate-backends)
- [Single Backend Setup](/docs/oauth/multiple-frontends-with-a-single-backend)


## 4. Update the login flow in your applications

In each of your individual `applications` you will have to setup up logic for handling the **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow.
We recommend using a generic **OICD** or **OAuth** library in order to do this.

<OAuthMobileTabs>

<TabItem value="react-native">

You can use the [react-native-app-auth](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-app-auth/) library. 
Just follow [the instructions](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-app-auth/docs/usage/config) to setup your application. 

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `issuer` corresponds to the endpoint of the **Authorization Service** `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}`
- `clientID` corresponds to `client_id`
- `redirectUrl` corresponds a value from `callback_urls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 
- `serviceConfiguration.authorizationEndpoint` corresponds to `authorize_url`
- `serviceConfiguration.tokenEndpoint` corresponds to `token_fetch_url`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android">


You can use the [AppAuth-Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) library. 
Just follow [the instructions](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android?tab=readme-ov-file#authorization-service-configuration) to setup your application. 

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

For the `AuthorizationServiceConfiguration` the parameters that you will have to provide are: `authorize_url` and `token_fetch_url`.
When calling the `AuthorizationRequest.Builder` function you can use `client_id` and a value from `callback_urls` to replace the example values.

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="ios">

You can use the [AppAuth-iOS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) library. 
Just follow [the instructions](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS?tab=readme-ov-file#auth-flow) to setup your application. 

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `clientID` corresponds to `client_id`
- `redirectUrl` corresponds a value from `callback_urls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 
- `authorizationEndpoint` corresponds to `authorize_url`
- `tokenEndpoint` corresponds to `token_fetch_url`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="flutter"> 

You can use the [AppAuth](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_appauth) library. 
Just follow [the instructions](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_appauth/tree/master/flutter_appauth) to setup your application. 

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `<client_id>` corresponds to `client_id`
- `<issuer>` corresponds to the endpoint of the **Authorization Service** `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}`
- `<redirect_url>` corresponds a value from `callback_urls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 

</TabItem>


</OAuthMobileTabs>


## 5. Test the new authentication flow

With everything set up, you can now test your login flow.
Just use the setup that you have created in the previous step to check if the authentication flow completes without any issues.
