# Reuse website login for desktop and mobile apps

This pattern is useful if you want to make use of the same web authentication experience that you for your desktop and mobile apps.
The flow will allow you to save develpoment time but you will have to keep in mind that it will not provide involve a native login experience.
Users will be directed to a separate browser page where they will complete the authentication flow.

In order to do this you will have to follow one of the previous guides based on your use case:
- If your applications use separate backend services check out [this guide](./multiple-frontends-with-separate-backends)
- If your appllications use a single backend service check out [this guide](./multiple-frontends-with-a-single-backend)
