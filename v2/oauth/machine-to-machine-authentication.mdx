# Machine to Machine Authentication

You can use the following guide if you want to implement a custom authentication flow between your microservices.

<img src="/img/oauth/machine-to-machine.png" alt="Machine to Machine Authentication"/>

The authentication flow will work in the following way:

1. `Service A` uses credentials to get an **OAuth2 Access Token**
2. [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) returns the **OAuth2 Access Token**
3. `Service A` uses the **OAuth2 Access Token** to communicate with `Service B`
4. `Service B` validates the **OAuth2 Access Token**
5. If the token is valid `Service B` returns the requested resource

:::info
This guide assumes that you already have setup and configured **SuperTokens** in your [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service). 

For more information on how to do that please check our [quickstart guide](/docs/thirdparty/introduction).

## 1. Enable the OAuth2 features from the Dashboard

You will first have to enable the **OAuth2** features from the **SuperTokens Dashboard**.
1. Open the **SuperTokens Dashboard**
2. Click on the **Enabled Paid Features** button
3. Click on **Managed Service**
4. Check the **OAuth 2.0** option
5. Click *Save* 

Now you should be able to use the OAuth2 recipes in your applications.

<!-- END COPY SECTION -->

## 2. Create the OAuth2 Clients


<CoreInjector defaultValue="https://<your-core-identifier>.aws.supertokens.io" showTenantId={false}>


For each of your **`microservices`** you will have to create a separate [**OAuth2 client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client).
This can be done by directly calling the **SuperTokens Core** API.

<AppInfoForm
    askForAppName
    askForAPIDomain
    askForWebsiteDomain
>
 


```bash
# You will have to run this for each one of your applications
# Adjust the client_name based on that
curl -X POST ^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/oauth2/admin/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: ^{coreInjector_api_key_without_quotes}" \
  -d '{
      "tokenEndpointAuthMethod": "none",
      "client_name": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
      "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
      "audience": ["<AUDIENCE_NAME>"]
    }'
```



- `client_name` - Then name of the client that will be used later for identification.
- `grant_types` - The grant types that the [**Client**](/introduction#client) will use. 
    - `client_credentials`: Allows the client to directly request an Access Token by authenticating itself with the Authorization Server using its own client credentials.
- `audience` - Value used to identify for whom a token was issued. When a service will request an **OAuth2 Token** that can be used on this client, the requested token should include one of the audience values.

If the creation was successful, the API will return a response that looks like this:

```json
{
    "client_name": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
    "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "callback_urls": [],
}

```

Based on the client creation process we can also infer the `authorization_url` value which is `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}oauth/auth`. We will use this later on.

## 3. Set Up your Authorization Service 

In your [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) backend you will need to initialize the **OAuth2Provider** recipe.

<BackendSDKTabs  disableOtherFrameworks>

<TabItem value="nodejs">

Update the `supertokens.init` call to include the new recipe.

1. Add the new import statement

```tsx

import OAuth2Provider from "supertokens-node/recipe/oauth2provider";

```

2. Update the list of recipes with the new initialization step.

```tsx

OAuth2Provider.init()

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="go">

:::caution

At the moment we do not have support creating OAuth2 providers in the Go SDK.

<TabItem value="python">

</BackendSDKTabs>


## 4. Generate Access Tokens

Now you can directly call the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-server) to generate Access Tokens.
Check the following code snippet to see how you can do that:


```bash

curl -X POST ^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/oauth/token \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "scope": ["<RESOURCE_SCOPE>"],
  "audience": "<AUDIENCE>"
}'

```

:::info

The scopes that you are requesting should be limited to just the ones needed to access a resource on the service that acts as a **Resource Server**.
Otherwise, if the scopes are too broad, the token could be used by the **Resource Server** to authenticate against other services in the network. 

:::

The **Authorization Server** will return a response that will look like this:

```json
{
    "access_token": "<TOKEN_VALUE>",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
```

You will have to save the `access_token` in memory so that you can use it in the next step.
The `expires_in` field will tell you how long the token is valid for.

## 5. Use the Generated Access Token 

Now that you have an **OAuth2 Access Token** you can use it when communicating with the other services.
Just keep in mind to generate a new one when it expires.

The service that will receive the request which includes the **OAuth2 Access Token** will have to verify it.
To see a detailed example of how to do this please check our [separate guide](/docs/oauth/customizations/verify-tokens).
