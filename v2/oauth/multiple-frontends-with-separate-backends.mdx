# Multiple frontend domains with separate backends

You can use the following guide if you have a single [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) that is used by multiple applications.
In turn, each app has separate **`frontend `** and **`backend`** instances that are served from different domains.
Using the actual **OAuth 2.0** terminology, each application can be considered a [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) while the **`backends`** are also [**Resource Servers**](/docs/oauth/introduction#resource-server).

:::info

Note that, if the *frontends* and *backends* are in different *sub domains*, you don't need to use *OAuth* and can instead use [session sharing across sub domains](/docs/session/common-customizations/sessions/share-sessions-across-sub-domains).

:::

<img src="/img/oauth/multiple-frontend-domains-with-separate-backends.png" alt="Multiple Frontend Domains with separate Backends"/>

The authentication flow will work in the following way:

1. The User accesses the `frontend` app
   - The application `frontend` calls a login endpoint on the `backend` application.
   - The `backend` application generates an `authorization` URL to the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) and redirects the user to it.
   - The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) backend redirects the user to the login UI
2. The User completes the login attempt 
   - The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) backend redirects the user to a `callback URL` that includes the **Authorization Code**.
3. The User accesses the callback URL
   - The **Authentication Code** gets sent to the application `backend` 
   - The `backend` exchanges the **Authentication Code** for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token)
   - The `backend` saves the received token in a server session and sends it back to the `frontend` as a cookie.

The `frontend` can now use the new cookie to access protected resources from the `backend`.

:::info
This guide assumes that you already have setup and configured **SuperTokens** in your [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service). 

For more information on how to do that please check our [quickstart guides](/docs/guides).

:::

<!-- COPY SECTION -->
<!-- ./oauth/multiple-frontends-with-separate-backends.mdx -->
<!-- 1 -->

## 1. Enable the OAuth2 features from the Dashboard

You will first have to enable the **OAuth2** features from the **SuperTokens Dashboard**.
1. Open the **SuperTokens Dashboard**
2. Click on the **Enabled Paid Features** button
3. Click on **Managed Service**
4. Check the **OAuth 2.0** option
5. Click *Save* 

Now you should be able to use the OAuth2 recipes in your applications.

<!-- END COPY SECTION -->

## 2. Create the OAuth2 Clients

<CoreInjector defaultValue="https://<your-core-identifier>.aws.supertokens.io" showTenantId={false}>

<AppInfoForm
    askForAppName
    askForAPIDomain
    askForWebsiteDomain
>

For each of your applications you will have to create a separate [**OAuth2 client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client).
This can be done by directly calling the **SuperTokens Core** API.

```bash
# You will have to run this for each one of your applications
# Adjust the client_name and redirect_uri based on that
curl -X POST ^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/oauth2/admin/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: ^{coreInjector_api_key_without_quotes}" \
  -d '{
      "client_name": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
      "response_types": ["code", "id_token"],
      "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
      "redirect_uri": ["https://<YOUR_APPLICATION_DOMAIN>/oauth/callback"]
    }'
```


- `client_name` - A human-readable name of the client that will be used for identification.
- `response_types` - Specifies the types of responses your client expects from the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-server). Most of the time, you would need the following two to be present:
    - `code`: Indicates that the [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) will receive an **Authorization Code** that will be exchanged for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
    - `id_token`: Indicates that the [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) expects an [**ID Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#id-token)
- `grant_types` - The grant types that the [**Client**](/docs/oauth/introduction#client) will use. 
    - `authorization_code`: Allows exchanging the **Authorization Code** for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
    - `refresh_token`: Allows exchanging the [**OAuth2 Refresh Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-refresh-token) for a new [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
- `redirect_uri` - A list of URIs to which the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-server) will send the user-agent (browser) after completing the authorization step. These can be deep links to mobile or desktop apps as well, but they must be exact URLs, without wildcards.

If the creation was successful, the API will return a response that looks like this:

```json

{
    "client_name": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
    "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "callback_urls": ["https://<YOUR_APPLICATION_DOMAIN>/oauth/callback"],
}


```

Based on the client creation process we can also infer two additional values that we will need later on:
- `authorize_url` corresponds to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}oauth/auth`
- `token_fetch_url` corresponds to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}oauth/token`

:::caution

You will have to save this response because we do not persist it internally for security reasons.
In the next steps we will use the values to complete several configurations.

## 3. Set Up your Authorization Service 

### Configure the Authorization Service Backend

In your [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) you will need to initialize the **OAuth2Provider** recipe.
The recipe will expose the endpoints needed for enabling the [**OAuth 2.0**](/docs/oauth/introduction#oauth-20) flow.


<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

Update the `supertokens.init` call to include the `OAuth2Provider` recipe.

1. Add the import statement for the recipe.

```tsx 
import OAuth2Provider from "supertokens-node/recipe/oauth2provider";
```

2. Update the list of recipes with the new initialization step.

```tsx
OAuth2Provider.init()
```

## 4. Set Up Session Handling in Each Application

In each of your individual `applications` you will have to setup up logic for handling the **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow.
We recommend using a generic **OICD** or **OAuth2** library in order to do this.

<OAuthBackendTabs>

<TabItem value="nodejs">

You can use the [passport-oauth2](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-oauth2/) library. 
Just follow the instructions on the library's page and setup your application `backend`. 
The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `authorizationURL` corresponds to `authorize_url`
- `tokenURL` corresponds to `token_fetch_url`
- `clientID` corresponds to `client_id`
- `clientSecret` corresponds to `client_secret`
- `callbackURL` corresponds to a value from `callback_urls`
- `scope` corresponds to `scope` 


Make sure that you expose an endpoint that will call `passport.authenticate('oauth2')`.
This way the user will end up accessing the actual login page served by the **Authorization Service**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="go">

You can use the [OAuth2](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2) library.
Just follow these [instructions](https://golang.org/pkg/golang.org/x/oauth2/#example-Config-RequestToken) and implement it in your `backend`.

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**.
- `ClientID` corresponds to `client_id`
- `ClientSecret` corresponds to `client_secret`
- `Scopes` corresponds to `scope`
- `Endpoint.AuthURL` corresponds to `authorize_url`
- `Endpoint.TokenURL` corresponds to `token_fetch_url`

Make sure that you expose an endpoint that will redirect to the authentication URL obtained from calling `AuthCodeURL`.
This way the user will end up accessing the actual login page served by the **Authorization Service**.

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="python"> 

You can use the [AuthLib](https://docs.authlib.org/) library.
Just follow these [instructions](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/oauth2.html) and implement it in your `backend`.

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**.
- `client_id` corresponds to `client_id`
- `client_secret` corresponds to `client_secret`
- `scope` corresponds to `scope` 
- `authorization_endpoint` corresponds to `authorize_url`
- `token_endpoint` corresponds to `token_fetch_url`

Make sure that you expose an endpoint that will redirect to the authentication URL obtained from calling `create_authorization_url`.
This way the user will end up accessing the actual login page served by the **Authorization Service**.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php"> 

You can use the [League OAuth2 Client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) library.
Just follow these [instructions](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/usage/) and implement it in your `backend`.

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**.
- `clientId` corresponds to `client_id`
- `clientSecret` corresponds to `client_secret`
- `redirectUri` corresponds to a value from `callback_urls` 
- `urlAuthorize` corresponds to `authorize_url`
- `urlAccessToken` corresponds to `token_fetch_url`

Make sure that you expose an endpoint that will redirect to the authentication URL obtained from calling `getAuthorizationUrl`.
This way the user will end up accessing the actual login page served by the **Authorization Service**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

You can use the [Spring Security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security) library.
Just follow these [instructions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/index.html#oauth2-client-log-users-in) and implement it in your `backend`.

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**.

- `client-id` corresponds to `client_id`
- `client-secret` corresponds to `client_secret`
- `scope` corresponds to `scope` 
- `issuer-uri` corresponds to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}` 

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="c#">

You can use the [IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel) library.
Just follow these [instructions](https://identitymodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/token.html#requesting-a-token-using-the-authorization-code-grant-type) and implement it in your `backend`.

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**.

- `Address` corresponds to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}` 
- `ClientId` corresponds to `client_id`
- `ClientSecret` corresponds to `client_secret`
- `RedirectUri` corresponds to a value from `callback_urls` 


Make sure that you expose an endpoint that will redirect to the authentication URL obtained by using [this example](https://identitymodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/request_url.html#authorization-endpoint). 
This way the user will end up accessing the actual login page served by the **Authorization Service**.

</TabItem>

</OAuthBackendTabs>


## 5. Update the login flow in your frontend applications

In your `frontend` applications you will have to add a login action that will direct the user to the authentication page.

The user should first be redirected to the `backend` authentication endpoint that was defined during the previous step.
There the `backend` will generate a safe `authorization` URL using the **OAuth2** library and then redirect the user there. 
After the user has logged in from the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/oauth/introduction#authorization-service) they will be redirected to the `backend` callback URL.
Then the authentication session will be created and the `backend` will send it to the user agent as a cookie.

## 6. Test the new authentication flow

With everything set up, you can now test your login flow.
Just use the setup that you have created in the previous step to check if the authentication flow completes without any issues.
