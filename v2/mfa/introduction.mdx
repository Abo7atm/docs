## Demo application
See our [example app on GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-mfa) that uses NodeJS and React. It has email password + social login (thirdpartyemailpassword recipe) as the first factor, and SMS OTP (passwordless recipe) or TOTP the second factor (depending on what the user enables).
