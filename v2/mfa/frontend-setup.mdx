# Frontend setup

## Single tenant setup

The pre built UI provides support for the following MFA methods:
- TOTP
- Email / phone OTP

If you want other types of MFA (like magic links, or password), please consider checking out the custom UI second.

We start by initialising the MFA recipe on the frontend and providing the list of first factors as shown below:

<FrontendPreBuiltUITabs>

<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import supertokens from "supertokens-auth-react"
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword"
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless"
import MultiFactorAuth from "superTokens-auth-react/recipe/multifactorauth"

supertokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        appName: "...",
        apiDomain: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init( /* ... */),
        Passwordless.init({
             contactMethod: "EMAIL_OR_PHONE",
        }),
        // highlight-start
        MultiFactorAuth.init({
            firstFactors: ["emailpassword", "thirdparty"]
        })
        // highlight-end
    ]
})
```

</TabItem>

</FrontendPreBuiltUITabs>

In the above snippet, we have configured thirdparty and email password as first factors. The second factor is configured [on the backend](./backend-setup), and is determined based on the [`n` array in the MFA claim in the session](./important-concepts#how-are-auth-factors-marked-as-completed). For example:
- If the `n` array in the session is `["otp-email"]`, then we will show the user the enter OTP screen for the email associated with the first factor login.
- If the `n` array in the session is empty, that means no login challenge is needed anymore, and the user will be redirected to the success screen, which is `/` by default.

If you notice, in the above code snippet, we have added `Passwordless.init` as well, and this handles cases where the second factor is `otp-email` or `otp-sms`. For TOTP, we have a different recipe as shown in later in this guide.
