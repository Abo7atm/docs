# Migration to SuperTokens

This section covers migration of secondary factors from your existing auth solution to SuperTokens. To see how to migrate the first factor, refer to our migration docs for the recipe you have setup as the first factor:

- [EmailPassword](/docs/emailpassword/migration/about)
- [ThirdParty](/docs/thirdparty/migration/about)
- [Passwordless](/docs/passwordless/migration/about)
- [ThirdPartyEmailPassword](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/migration/about)
- [ThirdPartyPasswordless](/docs/thirdpartypasswordless/migration/about)

After you have completed the first factor migration, you can focus on the secondary factor migration for the user. We will cover migration steps for each of the support secondary factors we have.
