# Set up Your SuperTokens Account 

:::info

This guide assumes that you are using the **SuperTokens** managed service.
If you want to self host the core service please check the [following guide](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core#self-hosting).

:::

## 1. Sign up for a SuperTokens account 

Open this [page](https://supertokens.com/auth) in order to access the account creation page.
Select the account that you want to use and wait for the action to complete.

## 2. Select the authentication method 

After you have created your account, you will be prompted with a form that will ask you to specify details about your configuration.
Select which authentication method that you want to use.

## 3. Select the region where you want to deploy the core service 

**SuperTokens** environments can be deployed in 3 different regions:

- US East (N. Virginia)
- Europe (Ireland)
- Asia Pacific (Singapore)

In order to avoid any latency issues please select a region that is closest to where your services are hosted.

## 4. Click the deploy button ðŸš€

Our internal service will deploy a separate environment based on your selection.

After this process is complete, you will be directed to the dashboard page.
Here you can view and edit information about your newly created environment. 

The main thing that we want to focus right now is the **Connecting to a development instance** section.
There you can see two different values, the `connectionURI` and the `apiKey`. We will use these values in the next pages in order to complete our setup.



:::info

The initial setup flow only configures a development environment.
In order to use **SuperTokens** in production, you will have to click the **Create Production Env** button.
