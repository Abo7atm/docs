# Managing user roles and permissions

You can manage [user roles and permissions](/docs/userroles/introduction) of your app from the user management dashboard.

## Initialisation

In order to get started with the user roles and permissions on user management dashboard you need to first initialise the UserRoles recipe in the `recipeList` on the backend.

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-node";
import Dashboard from "supertokens-node/recipe/dashboard";
import UserRoles from "supertokens-node/recipt/userroles"

SuperTokens.init({
  appInfo: {
    apiDomain: "...",
    appName: "...",
    websiteDomain: "...",
  },
  recipeList: [
    // TODO: Initialise other recipes if needed.
    Dashboard.init(),
    // highlight-start
    UserRoles.init()
    // highlight-end
  ],
});
```
:::important Note
Managing roles and permissions from the user management dashboard is only available from node sdk `v16.6.0` onwards.

## Managing roles and permissions

When you use the `UserRoles` recipe for the first time the list of roles will be empty. You can create roles by clicking on the add role button.

<img src="/img/dashboard/no-roles-created.png" alt="No roles created"/>

This will open up a modal which will allow you to create a role with its permissions. Permissions are just a list of strings assigned to a role.

<img src="/img/dashboard/create-role.png" alt="Create role"/>

Post role creation, the UI should list all the roles in your app.

<img src="/img/dashboard/roles-list.png" alt="Roles list"/>

Now you can preview the role that you have created by clicking on the role row. The modal allows you to edit or delete the role.

<img src="/img/dashboard/preview-role.png" alt="Preview role"/>

## Manging roles and users

In order to assign a particular role to a user you need to first find the user from the dashboard. Once you click on the user, you will see a user roles section in their details page.

If the user you've chosen belongs to multiple tenants, you can select a 'tenantId' from the dropdown menu to specify which tenant you'd like to assign roles to.

<img src="/img/dashboard/select-tenant.png" alt="Select tenant"/>

Click on the edit button to get started with assigning roles and then click on the "Assign Role" button which open's up a modal that lists all the roles that are avaliable to assign to this user.

<img src="/img/dashboard/assign-role.png" alt="Assign role"/>

You can remove a role assigned to a user by clicking on the "X" icon located next to that specific role.

Our Python SDK doesn't support roles management via the user management UI yet. Instead you can use the functions exposed by the SDK to manage roles and permissions. See a guide  [here](/docs/userroles/introduction).
