# Working with Scopes

The allowed scopes are set during the creation process of an **OAuth2 Client**.

By default, our **OAuth2** implementation adds the following built-in scopes:
- `email`: adds the `email`, `emails` and `email_verified` claims into the **ID Token** and the **User Info**.
- `phoneNumber`: adds the `phoneNumber`, `phoneNumbers` and `phoneNumber_verified` claims into the **ID Token** and the **User Info**
- `roles`: adds the roles claim into the **ID Token** and Access Token.
   - This will contain the roles returned by `getRolesForUser`
   - This only works if the `UserRoles` recipe is initialized
- `permissions`: adds the `permissions` claim into the **ID Token** and Access Token.
   - This will contain the list of permissions obtained by concatenating the result of `getPermissionsForRole` for all roles returned by `getRolesForUser`
   - This only works if the `UserRoles` recipe is initialized
 
## Requesting Specific Scopes

The client can request specific scopes by adding `scope` query param to the **Authorization URL**.
The requested scopes have to be a subset of what is allowed for the client, otherwise the authentication request will fail.
By default all scopes are granted to the client.

## Overriding granted scopes

If you want to manually modify the list of scopes that are granted to the client during the authentication flow you can do this by using overrides.
