# Social login

There are different flows that the third party login provider may support:
- _**Flow 1)**_ Via authorisation code (one time use code) - for web and mobile apps. 
    - _**a)**_ If you have configred the client secret on the backend:
        - The frontend sends the auth code to the backend, the backend exchanges that with the provided client secret to get the access token. The access token is then used to fetch user info and log them in.
    - _**b)**_ If you have **not** provided the client secret on the backend:
        - The backend uses PKCE flow to exchange the auth code with the user's access token. The access token is then used to fetch user info and log them in.
- _**Flow 2)**_ Via OAuth / access tokens - for mobile apps.
    - The access token is available on the frontend and is sent to the backend. SuperTokens then fetches user info using the access token and logs them in.

:::note
The same flow applies during sign up and sign in. If the user is signing up, the `createdNewUser` boolean on the frontend and backend will be `true` (as the result of the sign in up API call).

<h2>Flow 1a: Authorization code grant flow (Sign in with Google example)</h2>

<h3>Step 1) Redirecting to social / SSO provider</h3>

The first step is to fetch the URL on which the user will be authenticated. This can be done by querying the backend API exposed by SuperTokens (as shown below). The backend SDK automatically appends the right query params to the URL (like scope, client ID etc). 

After we get the URL, we simply redirect the user there. In the code below, we will take an example of login with Google:

<NpmOrScriptTabs>
<TabItem value="npm">

```tsx
import { ^{webjsGetAuthorisationUrl} } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";

async function googleSignInClicked() {
    try {
        const authUrl = await ^{webjsGetAuthorisationUrl}({
            thirdPartyId: "google",

            // This is where Google should redirect the user back after login or error.
            // This URL goes on the Google's dashboard as well.
            frontendRedirectURI: "http://<YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN>/auth/callback/google",
        });

<h3>Step 2) Handling the auth callback on your frontend</h3>

Once the third party provider redirects your user back to your app, you need to consume the information to sign in the user. This requires you to:
- Setup a route in your app that will handle this callback. We recommend something like `http://<YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN>/auth/callback/google` (for Google). Regardless of what you make this path, remember to use that same path when calling the `^{webjsGetAuthorisationUrl}` function in the first step.

- On that route, call the following function on page load

    <NpmOrScriptTabs>
    <TabItem value="npm">

    ```tsx
    import { ^{webjsThirdPartySignInUp} } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";

    async function handleGoogleCallback() {
        try {
            const response = await ^{webjsThirdPartySignInUp}();

            if (response.status === "OK") {
                console.log(response.user)
                if (response.createdNewRecipeUser && response.user.loginMethods.length === 1) {
                    // sign up successful
                } else {
                    // sign in successful
                }
                window.location.assign("/home");
            } else if (response.status === "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED") {
                // this can happen due to automatic account linking. Please see our account linking docs

                // SuperTokens requires that the third party provider
                // gives an email for the user. If that's not the case, sign up / in
                // will fail.

                // As a hack to solve this, you can override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user.

                window.alert("No email provided by social login. Please use another form of login");

<h3>Special case for login with Apple</h3>

<AppInfoForm
    askForWebsiteDomain
    askForAPIDomain
>

Unlike other providers, Apple will not redirect your user back to your frontend app. Instead, it will redirect the user to your backend with a `FORM POST` request. This means that the URL that you configure on the Apple's dashboard should point to your backend API layer in which **our middleware** will handle the request and redirect the user to your frontend app. Your frontend app should then call the `^{webjsThirdPartySignInUp}` API on that page as shown previously.

In order to tell SuperTokens which frontend route to redirect the user back to, you need to set the `frontendRedirectURI` to the frontend route (just like for other providers), and also need to set the `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` to point to your backend API route (to which Apple will send a POST request).

<h2>Flow 1b: Authorization code grant flow with PKCE</h2>

This is identical to flow 1a, except that you do **not** need to provide a client secret during backend init. This flow only works for providers which support the [PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

<h2>Flow 2: Via OAuth / Access token</h2>

This flow is not applicable for web apps.

<h2>Flow 1a: Authorization code grant flow (Sign in with Apple example)</h2>

<FrontendMobileSubTabs>

<TabItem value="reactnative">

<h3>Step 1) Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend</h3>

This involves setting up the [react-native-apple-authentication library](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication) in your app. Checkout their `README` for steps on how to integrate their SDK into your application. The minimum scope required by SuperTokens is the one that gives the user's email (In case of Apple, that could be the user's actual email or the proxy email provided by Apple - it doesn't really matter).

Once the integration is done, you should call the `appleAuth.performRequest` function for iOS and the `appleAuthAndroid.signIn` function for Android. Either way, the result of the function will be a one time use auth code which you should send to your backend as shown in the next step.

For iOS you use the normal sign in with apple flow and then use the id token to login with SuperTokens

```swift
import UIKit
import AuthenticationServices

fileprivate class ViewController: UIViewController, ASAuthorizationControllerPresentationContextProviding, ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate {
    func presentationAnchor(for controller: ASAuthorizationController) -> ASPresentationAnchor {
        return view.window!
    }

    func loginWithApple() {
        let authorizationRequest = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider().createRequest()
        authorizationRequest.requestedScopes = [.email, .fullName]
        
        let authorizationController = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [authorizationRequest])
        
        authorizationController.presentationContextProvider = self
        authorizationController.delegate = self
        authorizationController.performRequests()
    }
    
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
        guard let credential: ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential = authorization.credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential,
            let authorizationCode = credential.authorizationCode,
            let authorizationCodeString: String = String(data: authorizationCode, encoding: .utf8),
            let email: String = credential.email as? String,
            let nameComponents: PersonNameComponents = credential.fullName as? PersonNameComponents,
            let firstName: String = nameComponents.givenName as? String,
            let lastName: String = nameComponents.familyName as? String else {return}
        
        // Send the user information and auth code to the backend. Refer to the next step.
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="flutter">

For flutter we use the [sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) package, make sure to follow the prerequisites steps to get the package setup. After setup use the snippet below to trigger the apple sign in flow.

```dart
import 'package:sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple.dart';

void loginWithApple() async {
  try {
    var credential = await SignInWithApple.getAppleIDCredential(scopes: [
      AppleIDAuthorizationScopes.email,
      AppleIDAuthorizationScopes.fullName,
      // Required for Android only
      webAuthenticationOptions: WebAuthenticationOptions(
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        redirectUri: Uri.parse(
          "<API_DOMAIN>/<API_BASE_PATH>/callback/apple",
        ),
      ),
    ]);

    String authorizationCode = credential.authorizationCode;
    String? email = credential.email;
    String? firstname = credential.givenName;
    String? lastName = credential.familyName;

    // Send the user information and auth code to the backend. Refer to the next step.
  } catch (e) {
    // Sign in aborted or failed
  }
}
```

In the snippet above for Android we need to pass an additional `webAuthenticationOptions` property when signing in with Apple. This is because on Android the library uses the web login flow and we need to provide it with the client id and redirection uri. The `redirectUri` property here is the URL to which Apple will make a `POST` request after the user has logged in. The SuperTokens backend SDKs provide an API for this at `<API_DOMAIN>/<API_BASE_PATH>/callback/apple`.

<h3> Additional steps for Android </h3>

For android we also need to provide a way for the web login flow to redirect back to the app. By default the API provided by the backend SDKs redirect to the website domain you provide when initialising the SDK, we can override the API to have it redirect to our app instead. For example if you were using the Node.js SDK:

```tsx
import ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters} from "supertokens-node/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";

^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}.init({
    ^{nodeSignInUpFeatureStart}
    // highlight-start
        override: {
            apis: (original) => {
                return {
                    ...original,
                    appleRedirectHandlerPOST: async (input) => {
                        if (original.appleRedirectHandlerPOST === undefined) {
                            throw Error("Should never come here");
                        }

                        // inut.formPostInfoFromProvider contains all the query params attached by Apple
                        const stateInBase64 = input.formPostInfoFromProvider.state;

                        // The web SDKs add a default state
                        if (stateInBase64 === undefined) {
                            // Redirect to android app
                            // We create a dummy URL to create the query string
                            const dummyUrl = new URL("http://localhost:8080");
                            for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(input.formPostInfoFromProvider)) {
                                dummyUrl.searchParams.set(key, `${value}`);
                            }

                            const queryString = dummyUrl.searchParams.toString();
                            // Refer to the README of sign_in_with_apple to understand what this url is
                            const redirectUrl = `intent://callback?${queryString}#Intent;package=YOUR.PACKAGE.IDENTIFIER;scheme=signinwithapple;end`;

                            input.options.res.setHeader("Location", redirectUrl, false);
                            input.options.res.setStatusCode(303);
                            input.options.res.sendHTMLResponse("");
                        } else {
                            // For the web flow we can use the original implementation
                            original.appleRedirectHandlerPOST(input);
                        }
                    },
                };
            },
        },
        // highlight-end
        providers: [
            // ...
        ],
    ^{nodeSignInUpFeatureEnd}
})
```

In the code above we override the `appleRedirectHandlerPOST` API to check if the request was made by our Android app (You can skip checking the state if you only have a mobile app and no website). `sign_in_with_apple` requires us to parse the query params sent by apple and include them in the redirect URL in a specific way, and then we simply redirect to the deep link url. Refer to the README for `sign_in_with_apple` to read about the deep link setup required in Android.

<h3>Step 2) Calling the signinup API to consume the authorisation token</h3>

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain showMultiTenancyTab>

Once you have the authorisation code from the auth provider, you need to call the signinup API exposed by our backend SDK as shown below:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'rid: ^{codeImportRecipeName}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "thirdPartyId": "apple",
    "clientType": "...",
    "redirecURIInfo": {
        "redirectURIOnProviderDashboard": "^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/callback/apple",
        "redirectURIQueryParams": {
            "code": "...",
            "user": {
                "name":{
                    "firstName":"...",
                    "lastName":"..."
                },
                "email":"..."
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

<h2>Flow 1b: Authorization code grant flow with PKCE</h2>

This is similar to flow 1a, except that you do **not** need to provide a client secret during backend init. This flow only works for providers which support the [PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

<FrontendMobileSubTabs>

<TabItem value="reactnative">

<h3>Step 1) Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend</h3>

See the setup step for this in flow 1a. In addition to that, you need to configure the [react native auth library](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-app-auth) to also return the PKCE code verifier along with the authorization code. This can be done by setting the `usePKCE` boolean to `true` and also by setting the `skipCodeExchange` to `true` when configuring the react native auth library.

The minimum scope that is required by SuperTokens is one that gives you the user's email - in case of Google login, it is `"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"`.

<h3>Step 2) Calling the signinup API to consume the authorisation token</h3>

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain showMultiTenancyTab>

Once you have the authorisation code and PKCE verifier from the auth provider, you need to call the signinup API exposed by our backend SDK as shown below:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'rid: ^{codeImportRecipeName}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "thirdPartyId": "google",
    "clientType": "...",
    "redirectURIInfo": {
        "redirectURIOnProviderDashboard": "^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/callback/google",
        "redirectURIQueryParams": {
            "code": "...",
        },
        "pkceCodeVerifier": "..."
    }
}'
```

:::important
- The `clientType` input is optional and is required only if you have initialised the same provider multiple times on the backend (See the "Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps" section below).
- On iOS, `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` doesn't matter and its value can be a universal link configured for your app.
- On Android, the `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` should match the one configured on the Google cloud platform.
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user.
- `status: "NO_EMAIL_GIVEN_BY_PROVIDER"`: This is returned if the social / SSO provider did not provider an email for the user. In this case, you want to ask the user to pick another method of sign in. Or, you can also override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user for this provider.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overriden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen due to automatic account linking. Please see our docs for account linking for more information.

<h2>Flow 2: Via OAuth / Access token (Sign in with Google example)</h2>

<FrontendMobileSubTabs>

<TabItem value="reactnative">

<h3>Step 1) Fetching the OAuth / access tokens on the frontend</h3>

You can use the [react-native-app-auth library](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth) in your app to integrate with Google and get the user's access token. The minimum scope that is required by SuperTokens is one that gives you the user's email - in case of Google login, it is `"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"`.

:::important
When setting up on the Google dashboard, you need to generate OAuth credentials for an Android application which will be used for both iOS and Android. Google does not provide a client secret in this case, so on the backend, you can omit the `clientSecret` config in the `clients` array.
:::

<h3>Step 2) Calling the signinup API to use the OAuth tokens</h3>

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain showMultiTenancyTab>

Once you have the `access_token` or the `id_token` from the auth provider, you need to call the signinup API exposed by our backend SDK as shown below:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'rid: ^{codeImportRecipeName}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "thirdPartyId": "google",
    "clientType": "...",
    "oAuthTokens": {
        "access_token": "..."
    },
}'
```

:::important
- If you don't have the `access_token`, you can send the `id_token` instead.
- The `clientType` input is optional and is required only if you have initialised the same provider multiple times on the backend (See the "Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps" section below).
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:

<TabItem value="android">

For Android, Google recommends you to use their [official Andoird library](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating), which follows "Flow 1a" in these docs.

Essentially, the library will give you back a one time use auth code from Google which you can send to the `/signinup` API (as shown in Flow 1a -> Step 2) to exchange it with an access token and the user's information.

:::important
On Google's dashboard, you should create a Web client to use for your Android app, otherwise Google won't return an access token to you.

<h3>Step 1) Fetching the OAuth / access tokens on the frontend</h3>

For iOS, you use the [official guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) for setting up Sign in with Google in your app. After the user successfully signs in, you can access the access token and id token from the Google signin result.

```swift
import UIKit
import GoogleSignIn

fileprivate class ViewController: UIViewController {
    func signInWithGoogle() {
        let config = GIDConfiguration(clientID: "<CLIENT_ID>")

        GIDSignIn.sharedInstance.signIn(with: config, presenting: self) {
            user, error in
            guard error == nil, let _user: GIDGoogleUser = user else {
                // Sign in failed
                return
            }

            let accessToken = _user.authentication.accessToken

## Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps

If you have social / SSO login for your web and mobile app, then you might need to setup different client ID / secret for the same provider on the backend. For example, in case of Apple login, Apple gives you different client IDs for iOS login vs web & Android login (same client ID for web and Android).

In order to get this to work, you would need to add additional clients to the Apple.init on the backend. Each client would need to be uniquely identified and this is done using the `clientType` string. For example, you can add one `clientType` for `web-and-android` and one for `ios`.

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptTabs>
<TabItem value="npm">

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain askForWebsiteDomain>

We pass in the `clientType` during the init call.

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "^{form_apiDomain}",
