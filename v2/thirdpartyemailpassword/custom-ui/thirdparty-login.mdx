# Social login

There are different flows that the third party login provider may support:
- _**Flow 1)**_ Via authorisation code (one time use code) - for web and mobile apps. 
    - _**a)**_ If you have configred the client secret on the backend:
        - The frontend sends the auth code to the backend, the backend exchanges that with the provided client secret to get the access token. The access token is then used to fetch user info and log them in.
    - _**b)**_ If you have **not** provided the client secret on the backend:
        - The backend uses PKCE flow to exchange the auth code with the user's access token. The access token is then used to fetch user info and log them in.
- _**Flow 2)**_ Via OAuth / access tokens - for mobile apps.
    - The access token is available on the frontend and is sent to the backend. SuperTokens then fetches user info using the access token and logs them in.

:::note
The same flow applies during sign up and sign in. If the user is signing up, the `createdNewUser` boolean on the frontend and backend will be `true` (as the result of the sign in up API call).

<h2>Flow 1a: Authorization code grant flow (Sign in with Google example)</h2>

<h3>Step 1) Redirecting to social / SSO provider</h3>

The first step is to fetch the URL on which the user will be authenticated. This can be done by querying the backend API exposed by SuperTokens (as shown below). The backend SDK automatically appends the right query params to the URL (like scope, client ID etc). 

After we get the URL, we simply redirect the user there. In the code below, we will take an example of login with Google:

<NpmOrScriptTabs>
<TabItem value="npm">

```tsx
import { ^{webjsGetAuthorisationUrl} } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";

async function googleSignInClicked() {

            thirdPartyId: "google",

            // This is where Google should redirect the user back after login or error.
            // This URL goes on the Google's dashboard as well.

<h3>Step 2) Handling the auth callback on your frontend</h3>

Once the third party provider redirects your user back to your app, you need to consume the information to sign in the user. This requires you to:
- Setup a route in your app that will handle this callback. We recommend something like `http://<YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN>/auth/callback/google` (for Google). Regardless of what you make this path, remember to use that same path when calling the `^{webjsGetAuthorisationUrl}` function in the first step.

- On that route, call the following function on page load

    <NpmOrScriptTabs>
    <TabItem value="npm">

    ```tsx
    import { ^{webjsThirdPartySignInUp} } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";

            const response = await ^{webjsThirdPartySignInUp}();

            if (response.status === "OK") {
                console.log(response.user)
                if (response.createdNewUser) {
                    // sign up successful
                } else {
                    // sign in successful

                // SuperTokens requires that the third party provider
                // gives an email for the user. If that's not the case, sign up / in
                // will fail.

                // As a hack to solve this, you can override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user.

                window.alert("No email provided by social login. Please use another form of login");

<h3>Special case for login with Apple</h3>

<AppInfoForm
    askForWebsiteDomain
    askForAPIDomain
>

Unlike other providers, Apple will not redirect your user back to your frontend app. Instead, it will redirect the user to your backend with a `FORM POST` request. This means that the URL that you configure on the Apple's dashboard should point to your backend API layer in which **our middleware** will handle the request and redirect the user to your frontend app. Your frontend app should then call the `^{webjsThirdPartySignInUp}` API on that page as shown previously.

In order to tell SuperTokens which frontend route to redirect the user back to, you need to set the `frontendRedirectURI` to the frontend route (just like for other providers), and also need to set the `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` to point to your backend API route (to which Apple will send a POST request).

This involves setting up the [react-native-apple-authentication library](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication) in your app. Checkout their `README` for steps on how to integrate their SDK into your application. The minimum scope required by SuperTokens is the one that gives the user's email (In case of Apple, that could be the user's actual email or the proxy email provided by Apple - it doesn't really matter).

Once the integration is done, you should call the `appleAuth.performRequest` function for iOS and the `appleAuthAndroid.signIn` function for Android. Either way, the result of the function will be a one time use auth code which you should send to your backend as shown in the next step.

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'rid: ^{codeImportRecipeName}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{

```

:::important
- The `clientType` input is optional and is required only if you have initialised the same provider multiple times on the backend (See the "Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps" section below).
- On iOS, `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` doesn't matter and its value can be a universal link configured for your app.
- On Android, the `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` should match the one configured on the Apple developer dashboard.
- The `user` object contains information provided by Apple.
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user.
- `status: "NO_EMAIL_GIVEN_BY_PROVIDER"`: This is returned if the social / SSO provider did not provider an email for the user. In this case, you want to ask the user to pick another method of sign in. Or, you can also override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user for this provider.

For Android, Google recommends you to use their [official Andoird library](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating), which follows "Flow 1a" in these docs.

Essentially, the library will give you back a one time use auth code from Google which you can send to the `/signinup` API (as shown in Flow 1a -> Step 2) to exchange it with an access token and the user's information.

:::important
On Google's dashboard, you should create a Web client to use for your Android app, otherwise Google won't return an access token to you.

<h3>Step 1) Fetching the OAuth / access tokens on the frontend</h3>

For iOS, you use the [official guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) for setting up Sign in with Google in your app. After the user successfully signs in, you can access the access token and id token from the Google signin result.

```swift
import UIKit
import GoogleSignIn

fileprivate class ViewController: UIViewController {
    func signInWithGoogle() {
        let config = GIDConfiguration(clientID: "<CLIENT_ID>")

        GIDSignIn.sharedInstance.signIn(with: config, presenting: self) {
            user, error in
            guard error == nil, let _user: GIDGoogleUser = user else {
                // Sign in failed
                return
            }

            let accessToken = _user.authentication.accessToken
            let idToken = _user.authentication.idToken

            // TODO: See next step
        }
    }
}
```

<h3>Step 2) Calling the signinup API to use the OAuth tokens</h3>

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain showMultiTenancyTab>

Once you have the `access_token` or the `id_token` from the auth provider, you need to call the signinup API exposed by our backend SDK as shown below:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'rid: ^{codeImportRecipeName}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "thirdPartyId": "google",
    "clientType": "...",
    "oAuthTokens": {
        "access_token": "...",
        "id_token": "..."
    },
}'
```

:::important
- The `clientType` input is optional and is required only if you have initialised the same provider multiple times on the backend (See the "Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps" section below).
- If you have the `id_token`, you can send that along with the `access_token`.
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user.
- `status: "NO_EMAIL_GIVEN_BY_PROVIDER"`: This is returned if the social / SSO provider did not provider an email for the user. In this case, you want to ask the user to pick another method of sign in. Or, you can also override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user for this provider.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overriden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.

:::note
On success, the backend will send back session tokens as part of the response headers which will be automatically handled by our frontend SDK for you.

## Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps

If you have social / SSO login for your web and mobile app, then you might need to setup different client ID / secret for the same provider on the backend. For example, in case of Apple login, Apple gives you different client IDs for iOS login vs web & Android login (same client ID for web and Android).

In order to get this to work, you would need to add additional clients to the Apple.init on the backend. Each client would need to be uniquely identified and this is done using the `clientType` string. For example, you can add one `clientType` for `web-and-android` and one for `ios`.

For the frontend, you would need to use the right `clientType` as shown below:

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptTabs>
<TabItem value="npm">

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain askForWebsiteDomain>

We pass in the `clientType` during the init call.

```tsx
import SuperTokens from 'supertokens-web-js';

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "^{form_apiDomain}",
        apiBasePath: "^{form_apiBasePath}",
        appName: "...",
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    clientType: "web-and-android",
    recipeList: [/*...*/],
});
```

If you are using our pre built UI SDK (supertokens-auth-react) as well, you can provide the `clientType` config to it as follows:

```tsx
import SuperTokens from 'supertokens-auth-react';

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "^{form_apiDomain}",
        websiteDomain: "^{form_websiteDomain}",
        apiBasePath: "^{form_apiBasePath}",
        appName: "...",
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    clientType: "web-and-android",
    recipeList: [/*...*/],
});
```

</AppInfoForm>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="script">

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain>

We pass in the `clientType` during the init call.

```tsx
import supertokens from "supertokens-web-js-script";
supertokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "^{form_apiDomain}",
        apiBasePath: "^{form_apiBasePath}",
        appName: "...",
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    clientType: "web-and-android",
    recipeList: [/*...*/],
});
```

</AppInfoForm>

</TabItem>
</NpmOrScriptTabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mobile">

When making calls to the APIs from your mobile app, the request body also takes a `clientType` prop as seen in the above API calls.
