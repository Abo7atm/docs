# About account linking

Account linking is the process of associating multiple authentication methods with the same account. For example, a user may have a password-based account and a Google account, and they may want to link both of these accounts to the same user account in your application.

Account linking can be done automatically during user sign up. In this case, if a user signs up with a second login method with the same email or phone, the two accounts will be automatically linked. There is no need for you (the developer) to perform any additional steps. This approach, of course has a lot of security considerations, which we discuss in the [security considerations](./security-considerations) section.

The other method is to do manual account linking. Here, you (the developer) can make your own API which uses the account linking functions provided by our backend SDK to link two accounts. This API can then be called, for example, by your support team whenever needed.
