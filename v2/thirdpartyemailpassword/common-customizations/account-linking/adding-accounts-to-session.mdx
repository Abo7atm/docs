# Linking social accounts or adding a password to an existing account

There may be scenarios in which you want to link a social account to an existing user account, or add a password to an account that was created using a social provider (or passwordless login). This guide will walk you through how to do this.

The idea here is that we reuse the existing sign up APIs, but call them with a session's access token. The APIs will then create a new recipe user for that login method based on the input, and then link that to the session user. Of course, there are security checks done to ensure there is no account takeover risk, and we will go through them in this guide as well.

:::caution
We do not provide pre built UIs for this flow since it's probably something you want to add in your settings page or during the sign up process, so this guide will focus on which APIs to call from your own UI.

The frontend code snippets below refer to the `supertokens-web-js` SDK. You can continue to use this even if you have initialised our `supertokens-auth-react` SDK, on the frontend.
