# Security considerations for automatic account linking

Below is the list of all points in time when we do account linking, and for each point, you can see the list of security checks that happen:

## 1) During sign up:

### Case a
- Email is `e1`
- Email is verified: `false` (is the case with email password sign up or social login with a provider that does not require email verification)

#### Checks done:
- i) If there is no primary user with the same email, then we disallow sign up if there exists any other non-primary account with the same email and that account is not verified. We do this because if we didn't, there is a risk that if this user signs up and becomes a primary user, the other account (which could be malicious), might resend a verification email and the user might click on it (since they just signed up) and verify the malicious account, thereby linking it to their account. This way, the malicious user will have access to the victim's account.
- ii) If there exists a primary user with the same email, then we reject sign up of this new user. This is done cause if we allowed it, and this sign up is from a malicious user, then the actual user (the primary user owner) may get an email for verification, and might click it (since they did sign up previously). This will cause the new, malicious account to be linked, thereby giving the malicious user access to the victim's account. 

#### What users see: 
- i) In case of email password login, users see an account already exists error, in which case, they can try logging in with another method, or go through the password reset flow, which will create a new email password account for them as well as verify it.
- ii) In case of social login, users will see that they should try a different login method for security reasons.

### Case b

- Email is `e1`
- Email is verified: `true` (is the case with social login with a provider that requires email verification, like google, or it could be a passwordless sign up)

#### Checks done:
- i) Same as in Case 1a, point (i) above.
- ii) If there exists a primary user with the same email, then we allow sign up only if there exists at least one login method in the primary user with email `e1` which is verified. This is done because if we didn't, then the following account takeover is possible:
    - Malicious user signs up with email password, with email `e2`, verifies it, and becomes a primary user.
    - They then change their email to `e1`, and keep it in an unverified state.
    - Now the actual user (victim), does a google sign with email `e1`.
    - If we don't stop this sign up, then the new sign up will be linked to the primary user, and the malicious user will have access to the victim's account.

#### What users see: 
- Users will see that they should try a different login method for security reasons.

## 2) During sign in:
### Case a
- Email is `e1`
- Email is verified: `false`
- User is not a primary user

#### Checks done:
- If there exists another user with the same email, and they are not a primary user, but their email is unverified, we disallow this sign in because if we did, and this user verifies their email, it will result in this user becoming a primary user. If the other account then sends an email verification email, this user may click on it (they may not get too suspicious), and verify the other account, thereby linking it to their account. This way, the other account, which may belong to a malicious user, will have access to the victim's account.
- If there exists another user with the same email, and they are not a primary user, we disallow signing in. This is done cause if we allowed it, and this sign in is from a malicious user, then the actual user (the primary user owner) may get an email for verification, and might click it (since they did sign up previously). This will cause the new, malicious account to be linked, thereby giving the malicious user access to the victim's account. 

#### What users see:
- For email password sign in, users will see a wrong credentials error message. This will prompt them to go through the password reset flow, which will also mark the email as verified, thereby allowing them to sign in. This will also block sign ins from malicious users, since the new password is only known to the actual owner of the email.
- For passwordless or social login, users will see that they should try a different login method for security reasons.

### Case b
- The user first does a social login sign up with email `e1`.
- They then change their email to `e2` on the provider and tries signing in again.
- The third party provider does not verify emails, so `e2` is unverified.

#### Checks done:
- If the social login user is not a primary user, and there exists another primary user with email `e2`, then we disallow sign in here. This is done cause if we allowed it, and this sign in is from a malicious user, then the actual user (the primary user owner) may get an email for verification, and might click it (since they did sign up previously). This will cause the new, malicious account to be linked, thereby giving the malicious user access to the victim's account.
- If this user is a primary user, and there exists another primary user with email `e2`, we disallow sign in because there can't be two primary users with the same email. The email update which happens during sign in for social login, is rejected.

#### What users see:
- For the first point, users will see a message asking them to try a different login method, or contact support for security reasons.
- For the second case, users will see that email update is not allowed and to contact support.
