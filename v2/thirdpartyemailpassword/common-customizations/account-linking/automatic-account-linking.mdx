# Automatic account linking

Automatic account linking is a feature that allows users to automatically sign in to their existing account using more than one login method. On a high level, the accounts for the different login methods are linked automatically by SuperTokens provided that:
- Their emails or phone numbers are the same.
- Their emails or phone numbers are verified.

SuperTokens ensures that accounts are automatically linked only if there is [no risk of account takeover](./security-considerations).

## Enabling automatic account linking

You can enable this feature by providing the following callback implementation on the backend SDK:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import supertokens, { User, RecipeUserId } from "supertokens-node";
import AccountLinking from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking";
import { AccountInfoWithRecipeId } from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking/types";

supertokens.init({
    supertokens: {
        connectionURI: "<CONNECTION_URI_HERE_FROM_THE_POPUP>",
        apiKey: "<API_KEY_HERE_FROM_THE_POPUP>"
    },
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        // highlight-start
        AccountLinking.init({
            shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking: async (newAccountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId & { recipeUserId?: RecipeUserId }, user: User | undefined, tenantId: string, userContext: any) => {
                if (newAccountInfo.recipeUserId !== undefined && user !== undefined) {
                    let userId = newAccountInfo.recipeUserId.getAsString();
                    let hasInfoAssociatedWithUserId = false // TODO: add your own implementation here.
                    if (hasInfoAssociatedWithUserId) {
                        return {
                            shouldAutomaticallyLink: false
                        }
                    }
                }
                return {
                    shouldAutomaticallyLink: true,
                    shouldRequireVerification: true
                }
            }
        })
        // highlight-end
    ]
});

#### Input args meaning:
- `newAccountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId & { recipeUserId?: RecipeUserId }`: This object contains information about the user whose account is going to be linked, or will become a primary user. The object contains the user's email, social login info and phone number (whichever they used to sign in / up with). It also contains the login method (`emailpassword`, `thirdparty`, or `passwordless`). It may also contain the `recipeUserId` of the user that is going to be linked in case SuperTokens is attempting account linking during sign in.

    Notice that in case of `newAccountInfo.recipeUserId !== undefined && user !== undefined` being `true`, we add some extra logic to check if the user ID has any info associated with them in your application db. This is to prevent data loss for this user ID (see the [migtation section below](#migration-of-user-data-when-accounts-are-linked)).
- `user: User | undefined`: If this is not `undefined`, it means that `newAccountInfo` user is about to linked to this `user`. If this is `undefined`, it means that `newAccountInfo` user is about to become a primary user.
- `tenant: string`: The ID of the tenant that the user is signing in / up to.
- `userContext: any`: User defined userContext.

#### Output args meaning:
- `shouldAutomaticallyLink`: If this is `true`, it means that the `newAccountInfo` will be linked or will become a primary user during this API call (assuming a set of security checks pass). If this is `false`, it means that there will be no account linking related operation during this API call.
- `shouldRequireVerification`: If this is `true`, that account linking operations will only happen if the `newAccountInfo` is verified. **We strongly recommend keeping it set to `true` for security reasons.**

You can use the input of the function to dynamically decide if you want to do account linking for a particular user and / or login method or not.

## Different scenarios of automatic account linking

- **During sign up**: If there exists another account with the same email or phone number within the current tenant, the new account will be linked to the existing account if:
    - The existing account is a primary user
    - If `shouldRequireVerification` is `true`, the new account needs to be created via a method that has the email as verified (for example via passwordless or google login). If the new method doesn't inherently verify the email (like in email password login), the the accounts will be linked post email verification.
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

- **During sign in**: If the current user is not already linked and if there exists another user with the same email or phone number within the current tenant, the accounts will be linked if:
    - The user being signed into is NOT a primary user, and the other user with the same email / phone number IS a primary user
    - If `shouldRequireVerification` is `true`, the current account (that's being signed into) has its email as verified.
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

- **After email verification**: If the current user whose email got verified is not a primary user, and there exists another primary user in the same tenant with the same email, then we link the two accounts if:
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

- **During password reset flow**: If there already exists a user with the same email in a non email password recipe (social login for example), and the user is doing a password reset flow, a new email password user is created and linked to the existing account if:
    - The non email password user is a primary user.
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

## Affect on email verification
For a primary user, if there exists two login method (L1 & L2), and they both have the same email, but the email for L1 is verified and not for L2, SupeTokens will auto verify the email for L2 when:
- The user next logs in with L2.
- If you call `updateEmailOrPassword` from the email password or `updateUser` from the passwordless recipe, updating L2's email to be equal to L1's email.

## Affect on email update
When updating the email of a login method for a user, SuperTokens needs to make sure that the account linking conditions mentioned above remain intact. This means that you cannot update the email of a primary user to a value that matches the email of another primary user. 

For example, if User A has login method `AL1` (email `e1`) and `AL2` (email `e1`), and User B has login method `BL1` (email `e2`) and `BL2` (email `e3`), then we cannot update `AL1` email to `e2` or `e3` because that would lead to two primary users having the same email.

Now email updates can happen in different scenarios:
- 1) Calling the `updateEmailOrPassword` from the email password recipe
- 2) Calling the `updateUser` function from the passwordless recipe
- 3) Logging in via social login can also update emails if the email has changed from the provider's side.

In each of these cases, the operation will fail and an appropriate status code will be returned:
- For function calls (1) and (2), you will get back a response with a status indicating that email update was not possible.
- For social login API call (3), the client will get a response with a status indicating to contact support, with a support status code (see below).

## Migration of user data when accounts are linked
When two accounts are linked the primary user ID of the non primary user changes.

For example, if we have User A with with primary user ID `p1` and user B, which is a non primary user, and has a user ID of `p2`, and we link them, then the primary user ID of User B will be changed to `p1`. 

This has an effect that if the user logs in with login method from User B, the `session.getUserId()` will return `p1`. If there was any older data associated with User B (against user ID `p2`), in your database, that data will essentially be "lost".

To prevent this scenario, you should:
- Make sure that you return `false` for `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean in the `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` function implementation if there exists a `recipeUserId` in the `newAccountInfo` object, and if you have some information related to that user ID in your own database. This can be seen in the [code snippet above](#enabling-automatic-account-linking).

- If you do not want to return `false` in this case, and want the accounts to be linked, then make sure to implement the `onAccountLinked` callback:

    ```tsx
    import supertokens, { User, RecipeUserId } from "supertokens-node";
    import AccountLinking from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking";
    import { AccountInfoWithRecipeId, RecipeLevelUser } from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking/types";

    supertokens.init({
        supertokens: {
            connectionURI: "<CONNECTION_URI_HERE_FROM_THE_POPUP>",
            apiKey: "<API_KEY_HERE_FROM_THE_POPUP>"
        },
        appInfo: {
            apiDomain: "...",
            appName: "...",
            websiteDomain: "..."
        },
        recipeList: [
            AccountLinking.init({
                shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking: async (newAccountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId  & { recipeUserId?: RecipeUserId }, user: User | undefined, tenantId: string, userContext: any) => {
                    return {
                        shouldAutomaticallyLink: true,
                        shouldRequireVerification: true
                    }
                },
                // highlight-start
                onAccountLinked: async (user: User, newAccountInfo: RecipeLevelUser, userContext: any) => {
                    let olderUserId = newAccountInfo.recipeUserId.getAsString()
                    let newUserId = user.id;

                    // TODO: migrate data from olderUserId to newUserId in your database... 
                }
                // highlight-end
            })
        ]
    });
    ```

:::caution
If your logic in `onAccountLinked` throws an error, then it will not be called again, and will still have resulted in the accounts being linked.

## Support status codes
The following is a list of support status codes that the end user might see during their interaction with the login UI (as a general error message in the pre built UI).

### ERR_CODE_001 
- This can happen during creating a password reset code in the email password flow:
    - API path and method: `/user/password/reset/token POST` 
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "PASSWORD_RESET_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason":
            "Reset password link was not created because of account take over risk. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_001)",
    }
    ```
    - The pre build UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_001.png" alt="Pre built UI screenshot for showing error message." style={{
        height: "400px"
    }}/>

- Below is the scenario for when this status is returned:
    
    A malicious user, User A, which is a primary user, has login methods with email `e1` (social login) and email `e1` (email password login). If user A changes their emailpassword email to `e2` (which is now in unverified state), and the real user of `e2` (the victim) tries to sign up via email password, they will see a message saying that the email already exists. The victim may then try to do a password reset (thinking they had previously signed up). If we allow this to happen, and the victim resets the password (since they are the real owner of the email), then they will be able to login to the account, and the attacker can spy on what the user is doing via their third party login method.

    To prevent this scenario, we enforce that the password link is only generated if the primary user has at least one login method that has the input email ID and is verified, or if not, we check that the primary user has no other login method with a different email, or phone number. If these cases are not satisfied, then we return the error code `ERR_CODE_001`.

- To resolve this, you would have to manually verify the user's identity and check that they own each of the emails / phone numbers associated with the primary user. Once verified, you can manually mark the email from the email password account as verified, and then ask them to go through the password reset flow once again. If they do not own each of the emails / phone numbers associated with the account, you can manually unlink the login methods which they do not own, and then ask them to go through the password reset flow once again. **These actions can be taken via our user management dashboard.**

### ERR_CODE_002
- This can happen during the passwordless recipe's create or consume code API:
    - API path and method: `/signinup/code POST` or `/signinup/code/consume POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED";
        "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please try a different login method or contact support. (ERR_CODE_002)";
    }
    ```
    - The pre build UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_002.png" alt="Pre built UI screenshot for showing error message." style={{
        height: "400px"
    }}/>

- Below is as example scenario for when this status is returned (one amongst many):
    A user is trying to sign up using passwordless login method with email `e1`. There exists an email password login method with `e1`, which is unverified (owned by an attacker). If we allow the passwordless sign up, and then the attacker initiates the email verification flow for the email password method, the real user might click on the verification email (since they just signed up, they do not get suspicious), and then the attacker's login method is linked to the passwordless login method. This way, the attacker now has access to the user's account.

    To prevent this, we do not allow sign up with passwordless login in case there exists another account with the same email and is unverified.

- To resolve this issue, you should ask the user to try another login method (which already has their email), or then ask then manually mark their email as verified in the other account that has the same email, before asking them to retry passwordless login. **You can manually mark email for the other account as verified using the dashboard.**


### ERR_CODE_003
- Passwordless 
- API call: consumeCodePOST & createCodePOST

### ERR_CODE_004
- Third party
- API call: signInUpPOST
Signing in case

### ERR_CODE_005
- Third party
- API call: signInUpPOST
Signing in, when the email has changed and another primary user has the same email.

### ERR_CODE_006
- Third party
- API call: signInUpPOST

Signing up.

### Other edge cases
#### User is seeing incorrect email password combination / `WRONG_CREDENTIALS_ERROR`
- Email password
- API call: sign in

#### User is seeing email already exists / EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS_ERROR
- Email password
- Sign up
