# Automatic account linking

Automatic account linking is a feature that allows users to automatically sign in to their existing account using more than one login method. On a high level, the accounts for the different login methods are linked automatically by SuperTokens provided that:
- Their emails or phone numbers are the same.
- Their emails or phone numbers are verified.

SuperTokens ensures that accounts are automatically linked only if there is [no risk of account takeover](./security-considerations).

## Enabling automatic account linking

You can enable this feature by providing the following callback implementation on the backend SDK:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import supertokens, { User } from "supertokens-node";
import AccountLinking from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking";
import { AccountInfoWithRecipeId } from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking/types";

supertokens.init({
    supertokens: {
        connectionURI: "<CONNECTION_URI_HERE_FROM_THE_POPUP>",
        apiKey: "<API_KEY_HERE_FROM_THE_POPUP>"
    },
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        // highlight-start
        AccountLinking.init({
            shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking: async (newAccountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId, user: User | undefined, tenantId: string, userContext: any) => {
                return {
                    shouldAutomaticallyLink: true,
                    shouldRequireVerification: true
                }
            }
        })
        // highlight-end
    ]
});
```

#### Input args meaning:
- `newAccountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId`: This object contains information about the user whose account is going to be linked, or will become a primary user. The object contains the user's email, social login info and phone number (whichever they used to sign in / up with). It also contains the login method (`emailpassword`, `thirdparty`, or `passwordless`).
- `user: User | undefined`: If this is not `undefined`, it means that `newAccountInfo` user is about to linked to this `user`. If this is `undefined`, it means that `newAccountInfo` user is about to become a primary user.
- `tenant: string`: The ID of the tenant that the user is signing in / up to.
- `userContext: any`: User defined userContext.

#### Output args meaning:
- `shouldAutomaticallyLink`: If this is `true`, it means that the `newAccountInfo` will be linked or will become a primary user during this API call (assuming a set of security checks pass). If this is `false`, it means that there will be no account linking related operation during this API call.
- `shouldRequireVerification`: If this is `true`, that account linking operations will only happen if the `newAccountInfo` is verified. **We strongly recommend keeping it set to `true` for security reasons.**

You can use the input of the function to dynamically decide if you want to do account linking for a particular user and / or login method or not.
