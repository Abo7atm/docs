The **ThirdParty** flow involves creating a UI element that allows the user to initiate the login process.
This is usually done through a separate button for each provider that you have configured. You can have a look at our [UI implementation](https://master--6571be2867f75556541fde98.chromatic.com/?path=/story/thirdparty-auth--sign-in-up) to get a better idea.


After the user clicks one of those buttons the actions that you need to take will differ based on which type of authentication scenario you are using:

- **Authorization Code** 

This option can either involve a **Client Secret** that was configured on the backend or rely on **PCKE** exchange.
The difference between the two is that the first option involves using a private secret, on the backend, to get the access token.
Whereas the second step makes use of the **PCKE** flow to perform the token exchange.
Regardless of which step are you using, in the end, the access token will be used to fetch the user info and log them in.

- **OAuth/Access Tokens**

This option only applies to mobile/desktop apps.
The Access Token is obtained on the frontend and then sent to the backend.
SuperTokens then fetches user info using the access token and logs them in.
