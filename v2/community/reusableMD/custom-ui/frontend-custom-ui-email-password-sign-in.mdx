For the **Sign In** flow you will have to first add the UI elements which will render your form.
After that, call the following function when the user submits the form that you have previously created.

For the **Sign In** flow you will have to first add the UI elements which will render your form.
After that, call the following API when the user submits the form that you have previously created. 

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signin' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "formFields": [{
        "id": "email",
        "value": "john@example.com"
    }, {
        "id": "password",
        "value": "somePassword123"
    }]
}'
```

</AppInfoForm>

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID.
- `status: "WRONG_CREDENTIALS_ERROR"`: The input email and password combination is incorrect.
- `status: "FIELD_ERROR"`: This indicates that the input email did not pass the backend validation - probably because it's syntactically not an email. You want to show the user an error next to the email input form field.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overriden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during MFA. The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in was not allowed.

</TabItem>

On success, the backend will send back session tokens as part of the response headers which will be automatically handled by our frontend SDK for you.
