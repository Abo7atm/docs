# Upgrading SuperTokens core and SDKs

:::important
You need to follow these steps in order to properly upgrade supertokens
:::

In order to maintain compatibility and keep up on new features, we recommend upgrading your core and SDKs whenever possible.

## 1. Upgrade your core

You will need to shut down your core in order to upgrade it. After it's off, run the migration scripts for all major versions inbetween
your starting version and the version you are upgrading to. If the supertokens core version you have upgraded to shows as compatible
with your current front-end and back-end sdk's in the [compatibility table](./compatibility-table), then you can bring your core back online.
Otherwise, please leave your core offline as you continue to upgrade your other SDK's.
