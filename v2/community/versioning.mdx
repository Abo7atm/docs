# Viewing older versions of the documentation

You can use the [docs](https://github.com/supertokens/docs) repository on Github to check-out and view an older version of the documentation.

## 1. Finding the correct version of the documentation

The [release notes](https://github.com/supertokens/docs/releases) of the Github repo lists all the SDK versions the documentation is comptabile with. Find the correct version for you by looking at the version of the SDK you are using.

For example if you are using `supertokens-node` version `15.2.0` you want to find the version of the docs repository that mentions that it is compatible with 

```text
supertokens-node: 15.X.X
```

The release notes only mention the major version of the SDK it supports because all snippets are compatible with patch versions for a given major version.

## 2. Clone the repository and switch to the correct version

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supertokens/docs.git
```

Once downloaded, switch to the correct tag. The tag can be found on the releases page next to the version you are trying to use.

```bash
git checkout <TAG>
```

## 3. Setup the documentation project

Navigate to the `v2` folder:

```bash
cd v2/
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm i -d
```

## 4. Run the website locally

From inside the `v2` directory run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will build the project and start it on `http://localhost:3000` where you can view the full documentation.

If you see a screen that asks you to choose between user docs and contributing docs, use the user docs.
