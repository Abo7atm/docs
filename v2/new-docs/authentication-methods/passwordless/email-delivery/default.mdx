# Method 1) Default service

If you provide no configuration for email delivery, the backend SDK sends emails by talking to our servers on `https://api.supertokens.com` (for both self hosted and managed versions). This requires no setup from your side and can be used in production.

You can see the default email UI here:
- Default [passwordless login with OTP template](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#otp-login) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/otp-login.html).

- Default [passwordless login with magic link template](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#magic-link-login) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/magic-link-login.html).

- Default [passwordless login with magic link and OTP template](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#magic-link-login) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#magic-link--otp-login).
