# Argon2 Hashing

:::important
When using this, please make sure to run the calibration CLI command to find the right settings for your hardware.
:::

## Algorithm settings

### password_hashing_alg
This setting chooses which password hashing algorithm to use. For using Argon2, set this to `ARGON2`.

### argon2_iterations (Default is `1`)
This controls how much CPU processing power is used during hashing. The higher the value, the more processing power, and hence the more time each hash takes.

### argon2_memory_kb (Default is `87795` or 85 mb)
The amount of memory (RAM) that each hash takes. The higher this is, the harder it will be to crack hashes offline, and the longer the algorithm will take.

### argon2_parallelism (Default is `2`)
This is the number of threads the algorithm uses during hashing. The higher this is, the harder it would be to crack passwords offline using multile cores.

The value of this should be equal to the number of virtual cores (or twice the number of physical cores) available in the system.


### argon2_hashing_pool_size (Default is `1`)
This is the maximum number of concurrent hashes that will be done by the core. A value of `1` means that the core will do only one hash at one point in time, other requests for hashing will be queued up and wait for their turn.

:::tip example

If each hash takes 300 milliseconds, a value of `1` here would entail ~ a max of 3 hashes per second (1000 ms / 300 ms). A value of `2` here would entail a max of 6 hashes per second (1000 ms / 300 ms)*2.

Password hashing is carried out during sign in, sign up and password reset flows, therefore, you can set this value according to the target time per hash and how many sign ups / in you would expect per second.

## Changing settings

<SelfHostedTabs>
<TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
docker run \
    -p 3567:3567 \
    // highlight-start
    -e PASSWORD_HASHING_ALG=ARGON2 \
    -e ARGON2_ITERATIONS=1 \
    -e ARGON2_MEMORY_KB=87795 \
    -e ARGON2_PARALLELISM=2 \
    -e ARGON2_HASHING_POOL_SIZE=1 \
    // highlight-end
    -d registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="without-docker">

```yaml
# You need to add the following to the config.yaml file.
# The file path can be found by running the "supertokens --help" command

password_hashing_alg: ARGON2
argon2_iterations: 1
argon2_memory_kb: 87795
argon2_parallelism: 2
argon2_hashing_pool_size: 1
```

:::note
Changing settings will not affect older passwords. Older passwords will continue to be verified using the same settings as the ones when they were created.

## Calibration to your hardware

:::note
- This is only applicable for self hosted users. For managed service users, we have already calibrated the params based on our hardware.
- It can take several minutes for this algorithm to run.
:::

To find the optimal setting for your hardware, you can run the `hashingCalibrate` command via our CLI. This command takes a few params:
- `--with_alg`:
    - The value of this should be `argon2`
    - Compulsory param
- `--with_time_per_hash_ms`:
    - This is the target time per hash (in milliseconds) that we want to achieve.
    - The default value is `300`.
- `--with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`:
    - This is the number of concurrent hashes to run. This will affect how much memory is to be consumed per hash.
    - The default value is `1`
- `--with_argon2_max_memory_mb`:
    - This is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that should be consumed by the core for password hashing. The amount of memory per password hash will be `with_argon2_max_memory_mb / with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`.
    - The default value is `1024`.
- `--with_argon2_parallelism`:
    - This is the number of threads that should be used by argon2. The higher this is, the harder it will be to crack passwords offline.
    - The default value is `2*number of cores`

<SelfHostedTabs>
<TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
docker run registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name> supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=argon2
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="without-docker">

```bash
supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=argon2
```

</TabItem>
</SelfHostedTabs>

The above will produce an output like:
```text
====Input Settings====

-> Target time per hash (--with_time_per_hash_ms): 300 MS
-> Number of max concurrent hashes (--with_argon2_hashing_pool_size): 1
-> Max amount of memory to consume across 1 concurrent hashes (--with_argon2_max_memory_mb): 1024 MB
-> Argon2 parallelism (--with_argon2_parallelism): 4

====Final values====
Average time per hash is: 303 MS

argon2_memory_kb: 357104 (348 MB)
argon2_iterations: 2
argon2_parallelism: 4
argon2_hashing_pool_size: 1

====================
You should use these as docker env variables or put them in the config.yaml file in the SuperTokens installation directory.
```

The contents of the `====Final values====` gives you the values of the parameters to provide to the core.

The algorithm starts with the highest amount of memory per hash (= `with_argon2_max_memory_mb/with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`) and `1` iteration. It calculates the current average hashing time by simulating several hashes concurrently (based on the value of `with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`). If the hashing time is greater than the target time, it reduces the memory by 5%. If it's lesser than the target time, it increases the number of iterations. The algorithm stops if the current time is within 10 MS (higher or lower) of the target time.

:::tip debug
If you see an output like:
```bash
/usr/bin/supertokens: line 9: 15 Killed "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}"jre/bin/java -classpath "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}cli/*" io.supertokens.cli.Main false "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}" $@
```
it means that the system doesn't have enough memory. Try to run the algorithm again with a lower memory value by passing `--with_argon2_max_memory_mb`
