# Handling session expiry

:::important
This feature is only applicable if you are using our pre built UI, and are using the `<SessionAuth>` component to protect your routes. 
:::

A session can expire if:
- The user has been inactive for too long and their refresh token has expired.
- The session has been revoked from the backend, but not the frontend.

## Using the `onSessionExpired` prop

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { SessionAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
// @ts-ignore
import MyComponent from "./myComponent";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <SessionAuth
            onSessionExpired={() => {/* ... */ }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </SessionAuth>
    );
}
```

You will need to either reload the current page or redirect the user to the sign in page if you provide this callback.
