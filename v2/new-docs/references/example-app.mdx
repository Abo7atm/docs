# Example App

In order to get a quick understanding of how SuperTokens works you can make use of our example app.

Just run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest
```

The command creates two folders under the directory name that you have provided and sets up two basic projects based on the tech stack that you have chosen.

In the next chapters we exlain in detail the structure of each folder and how everything works together.

The reference documentation assumes that you are using the following tech stack:
- NodeJS/Express 
- React
Click on each link to adjust the selection based on your setup.

## Backend


This folder includes a sample server that exposes the authentication routes.

There are two files included in this project. 

##### `config.ts`

As the name suggests, this file configures the SuperTokens SDK and the features that your instance will use.
In it, you will find examples for the following setup steps:

1. Connecting to the **SuperTokens Core Service**. The value is set to `https://try.supertokens.com`. This is a demo server we host so you can get started quickly. Later on in the guide, we will spin up a dedicated managed or self hosted core service, and, based on that, we will updated the URL. 
2. Specifying details about your application. The information configured works for the demo app, but you will likely want to change it based on your setup. You can learn more about this config [here](/appinfo).
3. Selecting and initialising the authentication **recipes** that you need. Think of recipes as modules or features you enable. The list of recipes that are enabled here will affect which APIs are exposed via the **Backend SDK** middleware. Based on your use case, you may have to modify the parameters values provided to the recipes. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections. 

##### `index.ts`

This file initializes a simple Express server that makes use of two functions to expose the auth functionalities:
- `middleware`: This adds the authentication routes to the Express App 
- `errorHandler`: This manages the errors that can be thrown in the authentication flows and includes standardized responses

There are also examples on how to configure CORS, and how to use our session verification middleware to protect your endpoints. The endpoints in this file are just example ones and don't need to be added to your backend.

:::important
The order in which each function is called matters. You need to add the CORS config first, then the **SuperTokens** middleware and after that the rest of the
routes that you have in your project.

## Frontend

This folder includes a basic *SPA*, single page app, that uses the **SuperTokens React SDK** and a series of prebuilt components to provide an 
authentication UI for users.

##### `config.ts`

This file exports two main constants.
- The `SuperTokensConfig` object that describes the properties that should be used when we initialise the SDK.
- The `PreBuiltUIList`, which includes a series of prebuilt components that will be used in the authentication flows. 
In here you will have to adjust the `getApiDomain` and `getWebsiteDomain` functions based on your existing app setup.  
Besides that you may also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication recipe. But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `App.tsx`

Here is where we make use of the previously defined config and we start everything off.
1. The SDK gets initialised based on the configuration that we have previously defined. 
2. The entire app tree is wrapped with the `SuperTokensWrapper` component. This will provide a session context that can be used in all children components.
3. The authentication routes get included by calling `getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom` with our previously defined UI list. This example app uses `react-router-dom`, but we also have version of the function that does not rely on using react-router-dom. You can view an example [here](pre-built-ui/setup/frontend#3-setup-routing-to-show-the-login-ui)
4. Routes that should be protected by the SDK are wrapped with the `SessionAuth` component
