# Explore the documentation 

The tutorial that you just completed is just the beginning of your journey with **SuperTokens**.

There's plenty of other features and customizations that you can add on top of this to streamline your authentication experience.

## User Management 

We make it easier for you to manage and control users with our **User Management** feature.
There is a separate [section](/docs/new-docs/user-management/setup/user-management-dashboard/setup) in our docs that show you all the aspects of this offering.

## Multi Tenancy

If your use case involves different organizations that need to be separated from each other you can make use of our multi-tenancy offering.
Explore [our guides](/docs/new-docs/multi-tenancy/introduction) to see how you can add it to your application.

## Migration Guide

If you are coming from an existing authentication provider you can look at our [tutorial](/docs/new-docs/advanced-topics/migration/about) that helps you have an easier time switching services.

## Self Hosting

You can deploy **SuperTokens** inside your own infrastructure. 
We have extensive [guides](/docs/new-docs/advanced-topics/setup/core/with-docker) on how to do this and what to look after in order to make sure that everything works.
