# Customize the Authentication Experience 

**SuperTokens** exposes various ways in which you can customize the authentication experience that you expose to your users.

In this section, we will point out the main ways in which you can change some of the default confiurations while also providing references to more thorough guides.


## Customizing the UI

### Edit the Prebuilt UI

You can change many aspects of the components that come bundled with **SuperTokens**.
From [editing the styles](/docs/new-docs/customizations/common-customizations/styling/changing-colours), to [adding custom translations](docs/new-docs/customizations/common-customizations/translations) and [customizing the forms](/docs/new-docs), you can do this by following the guides from the **Customizations** section.



### Create your own UI

However, if the the prebuilt UI doesn't suit your needs, you can create your own UI from scratch.
We have a [complete guide](/docs/new-docs/customizations/custom-ui/init/frontend) on how to do this.
Just keep in mind that, in some of the other guides, you will have to select the instructions specific to custom ui implementations. 

## Overrides

One of the most powerful ways to customize things with **SuperTokens** is by using **Overrides**.
They provide a simple way to implement your own custom logic over the common functions and components that are exposed through our **SDKs**.

Take a look at the [Overrides section](/docs/new-docs/customizations/advanced-customizations/overview) to see how you can use them.

## Recipe specific Customizations

Each **Authentication Method** has specific settings and behaviours that can be adjusted based on your needs.
Check the **Authentication Methods** section, from the left navigation menu, to see how you can update each flow.
