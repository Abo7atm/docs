# Using Vercel

## With NextJS
Please see our NextJS guide (on the left navigation list) and get it to work for your local dev env.

<PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>

<PreBuiltUIContent>

## With other stacks
- Please follow the [setup section](../../pre-built-ui/setup/frontend) and make sure you complete all steps mentioned in it.
- For NodeJS apps, Vercel allows you to [run a standalone Node express server on the backend](https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel#standalone-express). You can [read this blog](https://supertokens.com/blog/how-to-deploy-supertokens-with-react-nodejs-express-on-vercel) on how to deploy SuperTokens with React + Express on Vercel.

## Working with Vercel's inspect and production URL

Vercel provides one production URL per app and one unique inspect URL per deployment. To get SuperTokens to work with dynamic URLs, you need to make the following changes to the [`appInfo` object](../../appinfo):

### On the frontend

```text
appInfo = {
    apiDomain: window.location.origin,
    websiteDomain: window.location.origin,
    ...
}
```

### On the backend

```text
appInfo = {
    apiDomain: process.env.VERCEL_URL,
    websiteDomain: process.env.VERCEL_URL,
    ...
},
```

Vercel adds an env var to the backend - `VERCEL_URL`, which points to the current URL that the app is deployed on. This allows SuperTokens to work on all inspect URLs generated by Vercel without you having to keep changing your code.

:::note
The above setting works only if your backend and frontend are deployed on the same URL. If you are using a different backend and using Vercel only for your frontend, then:
- Set the `apiDomain` on the frontend and backend to point to your backend.
- The `websiteDomain` on the frontend should be `window.location.origin`, but on the backend, it should be equal to your production deployment URL. This will break certain features of the app for inspect URL deployments, but it will work as expected for production deployments.
