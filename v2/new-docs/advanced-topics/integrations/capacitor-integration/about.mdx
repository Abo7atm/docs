# Capacitor integration with SuperTokens

To integrate SuperTokens with your capacitor app we recommend using [capacitor-supertokens-nextjs-turborepo](https://github.com/RobSchilderr/capacitor-supertokens-nextjs-turborepo) which is a community created template project with SuperTokens already set up for NextJS on the web and mobile using capacitor.

:::important
The `supertokens-web-js` /`supertokens-auth-react` SDKs use frontend cookies to store the session tokens. For this to work on mobile apps with Capacitor, you will need to enable [cookies in Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/cookies).
