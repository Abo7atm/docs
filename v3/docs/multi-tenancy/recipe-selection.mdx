# Setting up login for tenants

<PaidFeatureBanner />

Once you have [created tenants](./new-tenant) for your app with specific login methods enabled for them (thirdparty, email password, passwordless), you have to pick which **authentication recipe** to use in your app.

:::info Note
By default, when the core first starts, or when you create a new app in the core, SuperTokens creates a tenant (with tenantId as `"public"`), and enables all the login methods for them.
:::

The authentication recipes you will choose  will depend on which login methods you have enabled across all tenants in your app. Here are a few examples:

- If you have enabled email password login for all tenants, you can use the [emailpassword recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/authentication/email-password/introduction).
- If you have enabled third party login for all tenants, you can use the [thirdparty recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/authentication/social/introduction).
- If you have enabled passwordless login for all tenants, you can use the [passwordless recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/authentication/passwordless/introduction).
- SuperTokens will automatically pick the right recipe for each tenant.

Once you have selected the right recipe for your application, you should follow the setup guides and implement the specific authentication flow for your tenant.
