# Delete an app from SuperTokens core

The following guide will show you how to delete an app from a SuperTokens Core instance. This operation is irreversible and will delete all user data associated with the app.

## Before you start

Before you delete an app you need to make sure that the following requirements are met:
- The request must originate from the public app and tenant
- The app must not have any tenants other than the public tenant. You'll need to delete other tenants first.

## Deleting an app using the API

:::danger
This operation cannot be undone. Make sure you have backed up any important data before proceeding.
:::

To delete an app from the SuperTokens core, you can use the following cURL command:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{coreInfo.uri}/recipe/multitenancy/app/remove' \
--header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "appId": "app1"
}'
```

- The above command will delete the app with the `appId` of `app1` and all its associated tenants.
- All user data, configuration, and tenant information associated with this app will be permanently deleted.
- The API key used must have the necessary permissions to delete apps.

:::important
After deleting an app, make sure to update any backend services that were configured to use this app ID to prevent unexpected errors.
