# Password hashing

## Overview

**SuperTokens** supports two password hashing algorithms: `BCrypt` and `Argon2`.
As per current best practices, `Argon2` is the recommended algorithm. 
However, **SuperTokens** uses `BCrypt` by default since `Argon2` requires custom settings that are specific to the hardware in which the core is running on.

### Hashing time

The key metric to aim for when hashing passwords is the amount of time each hash would take.
By default, **SuperTokens** has configured these algorithms to take 300 milliseconds per hash on a machine with 1 GB of RAM and 2 virtual CPU cores.

## Change the hashing algorithm

You can switch algorithms whenever you want.
The change will affect only the new users that sign up.
Previous passwords are decrypted using the original algorithm.
For example, if a password was hashed with `BCrypt`, it will be verified using `BCrypt` even if the core configuration was changed to `Argon2`.

Instructions:

<AccountTypeCard>

  <AccountTypeCard.ManagedContent>
      1. Go to the SuperTokens SaaS dashboard.
      2. Click "Edit Configuration" on the environment you want to change.
      3. Find the `password_hashing_alg` property and change it.
      4. Click "Save".

## Hashing calibration

This information is relevant only for self hosted core instances.
The managed service instances have already calibrated the algorithms based on our hardware.

:::important
When you change the hashing settings make sure to run the calibration CLI command to find the right balance for your hardware.

#### Algorithm settings

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `password_hashing_alg` | - | This setting chooses which password hashing algorithm to use. For using Argon2, set this to `ARGON2`. |
| `argon2_iterations` | `1` | This controls how much CPU processing power is used during hashing. The higher the value, the more processing power, and hence the more time each hash takes. |
| `argon2_memory_kb` | `87795` (85 MB) | The amount of memory (RAM) that each hash takes. The higher this is, the harder it will be to crack hashes offline, and the longer the algorithm will take. |
| `argon2_parallelism` | `2` | This is the number of threads the algorithm uses during hashing. The higher this is, the harder it would be to crack passwords offline using multiple cores. Should be equal to the number of virtual cores (or twice the number of physical cores) available in the system. |
| `argon2_hashing_pool_size` | `1` | This is the maximum number of concurrent hashes that will be done by the core. A value of `1` means that the core will do only one hash at one point in time, other requests for hashing will be queued up and wait for their turn. |


##### Example

If each hash takes 300 milliseconds, a value of `1` here would entail ~ a max of 3 hashes per second (1000 ms / 300 ms). A value of `2` here would entail a max of 6 hashes per second (1000 ms / 300 ms)*2.

Password hashing is carried out during sign in, sign up and password reset flows, therefore, you can set this value according to the target time per hash and how many sign ups / in you would expect per second.

#### Calibrate to your hardware


To find the optimal setting for your hardware, you can run the `hashingCalibrate` command via our CLI. This command takes a few params:
- `--with_alg`:
    - The value of this should be `argon2`
    - Compulsory param
- `--with_time_per_hash_ms`:
    - This is the target time per hash (in milliseconds) that we want to achieve.
    - The default value is `300`.
- `--with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`:
    - This is the number of concurrent hashes to run. This will affect how much memory is to be consumed per hash.
    - The default value is `1`
- `--with_argon2_max_memory_mb`:
    - This is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that should be consumed by the core for password hashing. The amount of memory per password hash will be `with_argon2_max_memory_mb / with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`.
    - The default value is `1024`.
- `--with_argon2_parallelism`:
    - This is the number of threads that should be used by argon2. The higher this is, the harder it will be to crack passwords offline.
    - The default value is `2*number of cores`

It can take several minutes for this algorithm to run.

```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>

<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="without-docker">

```bash
supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=argon2
```

</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above will produce an output like:

====Input Settings====

-> Target time per hash (--with_time_per_hash_ms): 300 MS
-> Number of max concurrent hashes (--with_argon2_hashing_pool_size): 1

====Final values====
Average time per hash is: 303 MS

argon2_memory_kb: 357104 (348 MB)
argon2_iterations: 2
argon2_parallelism: 4
argon2_hashing_pool_size: 1

====================
You should use these as docker environment variables or put them in the config.yaml file in the SuperTokens installation directory.
```

The contents of the `====Final values====` gives you the values of the parameters to provide to the core.

The algorithm starts with the highest amount of memory per hash (= `with_argon2_max_memory_mb/with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`) and `1` iteration. It calculates the current average hashing time by simulating several hashes concurrently (based on the value of `with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`). If the hashing time is greater than the target time, it reduces the memory by 5%. If it's lesser than the target time, it increases the number of iterations. The algorithm stops if the current time is within 10 MS (higher or lower) of the target time.

:::info debug
If you see an output like:
```bash
/usr/bin/supertokens: line 9: 15 Killed "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}"jre/bin/java -classpath "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}cli/*" io.supertokens.cli.Main false "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}" $@
```
it means that the system doesn't have enough memory. Try to run the algorithm again with a lower memory value by passing `--with_argon2_max_memory_mb`

#### Calibrate to your hardware

To find the optimal setting for your hardware, you can run the `hashingCalibrate` command via our CLI. This command takes a few params:
- `--with_alg`:
    - The value of this should be `bcrypt`.
    - Compulsory param
- `--with_time_per_hash_ms`:
    - This is the target time per hash (in milliseconds) that we want to achieve.
    - The default value is `300`

<SelfHostingTabs>
<SelfHostingTabs.Tab value="with-docker">

```bash
docker run registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name> supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=bcrypt
```
</SelfHostingTabs.Tab>

<SelfHostingTabs.Tab value="without-docker">

```bash
supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=bcrypt
```

</SelfHostingTabs.Tab>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above will produce an output like:
```text
====Input Settings====
-> Target time per hash (--with_time_per_hash_ms): 300 MS


====Running algorithm====

Current log rounds: 11
..........Took 158 MS per hash

Incrementing log rounds and trying again...

Current log rounds: 12
..........Took 310 MS per hash

====Final values====
Average time per hash is: 310 MS

bcrypt_log_rounds: 12

====================
You should use this as a docker environment variable or put this in the config.yaml file in the SuperTokens installation directory.
```

The contents of the `====Final values====` gives you the values of the parameters to provide to the core.

The algorithm starts with the minimum recommended value (`11`), and increments it until the average time per hash is greater than the target time. The final value is then equal to the value that yields the closest time per hash as the target one.
