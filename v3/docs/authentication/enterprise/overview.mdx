  Explore multi-tenant login features, including SSO, unique login methods, and
  dynamic tenant creation.

## Features

### Enterprise SSO / SAML login
- Allows your customers to login using their Workforce IdP (OAuth 2.0 & SAML supported). The list of in built providers is stated above, but you can also easily define a custom provider in case we don't support it out of the box.
- Allow your customers to add and configure their SSO provider themselves. SuperTokens gives you all the building blocks required for this so that you can let customers add their own SSO provider with zero manual intervention from your side during customer onboarding.

### Unique login methods per tenant
Each tenant can have its own login method. For example, one tenant can have email password login, while another can have SSO login.

### Different user pools
Each tenant will have its own user pool.
- Isolating users to their organisation becomes very simple.
- This also means that one user can login using the same email across different tenants and they will be treated as different users. You can also share a user across tenants.

### Data isolation
In addition to the above, this feature can also be used to [implement data isolation for each of your tenants](./new-tenant-config#providing-additional-configuration-per-tenant) wherein a different database is used per tenant.

### Dynamic tenant creation
You can create and configure a tenant via few, simple API calls from your backend API layer. No need to manually onboard customers anymore.

### Multiple development environments
Create multiple development or staging environments to help with your development process. You can also create a new environment on the fly for CICD testing purposes.

### Flexible tenant discovery
Use any form of tenant discovery method. For example, use one sub domain per tenant, or a form for tenant selection. The form can have a list of tenants to choose from, or an input box to enter the tenantId / workspace URL / identifier - as defined by you.

## Types of UX flows

In this section, we will explore how to implement different forms of multi tenant login experiences:
- **Tenants use a common domain to login**: All tenants login using the same page (for example, `example.com/auth`) and are optionally redirected to their sub domain post login. At the start of the login flow, the customer will have to input their tenantId / workspace URL / identifier - as defined by you, and the login methods shown would be based on their tenantId.
- **Tenants use their sub domain to login**: Here, each tenant has a sub domain assigned to them (for example `customer1.example.com`, `customer2.example.com`, ...), and they would visit their sub domain to login and access their app. Each sub domain's login experience may be different (as defined by you or the tenant).

SuperTokens is flexible enough to allow other forms of UX as well, but since the above two flow are most common, we provide dedicated docs for them.
