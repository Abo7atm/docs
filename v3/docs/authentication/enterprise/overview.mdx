  dynamic tenant creation.

## Features

### Enterprise SSO / SAML Login
- Allows your customers to login using their Workforce IdP (OAuth 2.0 & SAML supported). The list of built-in providers is mentioned above, but you can also define a custom provider if it is not supported out of the box.
- Allow your customers to add and configure their SSO provider themselves. SuperTokens provides all the building blocks required for this so that customers can add their own SSO provider with zero manual intervention during customer onboarding.

### Unique login methods per tenant
Each tenant can have its own login method. For example, one tenant can have email password login, while another can have SSO login.

### Different user pools
Each tenant has its own user pool.
- Isolating users to their organisation becomes simple.
- This also means that one user can login using the same email across different tenants and they are treated as different users. You can also share a user across tenants.

### Data isolation
Also, this feature can be used to [implement data isolation for each of your tenants](./new-tenant-config#providing-additional-configuration-per-tenant) wherein a different database is used per tenant.

### Dynamic tenant creation
You can create and configure a tenant via few, simple API calls from your backend API layer. No need to manually onboard customers anymore.

### Multiple development environments
Create multiple development or staging environments to help with your development process. You can also create a new environment on the fly for CI/CD testing purposes.

### Flexible tenant discovery
Use any form of tenant discovery method. For example, use one subdomain per tenant, or a form for tenant selection. The form can have a list of tenants to choose from, or an input box to enter the `tenantId` / workspace URL / identifier - as defined by you.

## Types of UX Flows

In this section, different forms of multi-tenant login experiences are explored:
- **Tenants use a common domain to login**: All tenants login using the same page (for example, `example.com/auth`) and are optionally redirected to their subdomain post login. At the start of the login flow, the customer has to input their `tenantId` / workspace URL / identifier - as defined by you, and the login methods shown are based on their `tenantId`.
- **Tenants use their sub domain to login**: Here, each tenant has a sub domain assigned to them (for example `customer1.example.com`, `customer2.example.com`, ...), and they would visit their sub domain to login and access their app. Each sub domain's login experience may be different (as defined by you or the tenant).

SuperTokens is flexible enough to allow other forms of UX as well, but since the above two flows are most common, dedicated docs are provided for them.
