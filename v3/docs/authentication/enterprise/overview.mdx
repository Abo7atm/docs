# Enterprise authentication

## Overview 

Enterprise authentication offers secure and scalable solutions for managing user access across an organization's applications and services.
You can use **SuperTokens** to build a multi-tenant authentication functionality in your application.
This page presents the a high-level perspective of the enterprise features exposed by the different SDK recipes and authentication flows that you can build.

## Features

### Enterprise SSO / SAML login

- **Streamlined Authentication:** Your customers can log in using their Workforce IdP with support for OAuth 2.0 and SAML.
- **Self-Service Configuration:** Your customers can add and configure their own SSO providers.

### Unique login methods per tenant

Each tenant can have its own login method.
For example, one tenant can have email password login, while another can have SSO login.

### Different user pools

Each tenant has its own user pool.
Users can login using the same email across different tenants.
Their account can differ for each tenant or they can use the same one.

### Data isolation

You can use this feature to implement data isolation for each of your tenants.
This way a different database gets used per tenant.

### Dynamic tenant creation

You can create and configure a tenant via API calls from your backend API layer.
No need to manually onboard customers anymore.

### Multiple development environments

Create multiple development or staging environments to help with your development process.
You can also create a new environment on the fly for CI/CD testing purposes.

### Flexible tenant discovery

Use any form of tenant discovery method.
For example, use one subdomain per tenant, or a form for tenant selection.
The form can have a list of tenants to choose from, or an input box to enter the `tenantId` / workspace URL / identifier, 

## Types of UX flows


Users can login in a multi-tenant setup in two different ways:
- **Common Domain Login:** All tenants use the same login page, `example.com/auth`.
After logging in, users are optionally redirected to their respective subdomains.
At the beginning of the login process, customers enter their `tenantId`, workspace URL, or another identifier, and the available login methods adjust based on the provided `tenantId`.
  
- **Subdomain Login:** Each tenant accesses their own subdomain (`customer1.example.com`, `customer2.example.com`) to log in and access their application.
Each subdomain can offer a unique login experience, as defined by you or the tenant.
