# What is SAML?

SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is an open protocol that is used to exchange information between the auth server and the client application. Some identity providers require OAuth 2.0 for user login, some require SAML, and some can work with both.

## How does SAML work?

In a nutshell, your SAML identity provider will provide a metadata file (which is a .xml file) which you or your end users need to upload to the SAML client.

The `.xml` metadata file contains (amongst other things):
- A unique entity ID that you must keep private. This is used by the SAML provider to identify your application.
- A public certificate that is used to verify the signature attached to the incoming SAML response. This ensures the response is coming from the expected Identity Provider.
- Information about where to redirect the end user to when they click on the login button in your application. This URL will be to a website that is controlled by the SAML provider and will ask the end user for their credentials.


## How to add SAML login to SuperTokens?

SuperTokens is not a SAML client. This means, that you will have to use a third party solution along with SuperTokens to integrate with a SAML provider. The way this will work is that the third party solution will act as an OAuth 2.0 provider to SuperTokens, and a SAML client to the SAML provider:

The following pages in this section will guide you through some examples of third party solutions that you can use alongside of SuperTokens.


## What is BoxyHQ

[BoxyHQ](https://boxyhq.com/) is a commercial open-source company that has a product called "SAML Jackson" which helps integrate SAML providers into your application.

SAML Jackson is a perfect fit with SuperTokens because:
- It's an OAuth provider and a SAML client. This fits in perfectly with our architecture.
- For self hosted, it supports PostgreSQL and MySQL amongst [other databases](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/service#database). Self hosted SuperTokens supports PostgreSQL and MySQL as well.

In the next page, we will have a look at the architecture and flow diagram of SuperTokens + SAML Jackson.

:::info Example App
We have an [example app on our GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/jackson-supertokens-express) with SuperTokens + SAML Jackson, for React and NodeJS express apps. This uses [mocksaml.com](https://mocksaml.com/) as a SAML provider

## 1. Architecture and flow diagram with SuperTokens + BoxyHQ (SAML Jackson)

SAML Jackson providers an HTTP service that you can host yourself or let BoxyHQ manage. The HTTP service is written in NodeJS, and is embeddable within your NodeJS backend. However, because SuperTokens supports multiple backends, we will focus on deploying SAML Jackson as a microservice.

- 1. The user clicks on the login button and is redirected to SAML Jackson's microservice at `http://localhost:5225/api/oauth/authorize`

- 2. SAML Jackson redirects the user to the SAML provider's login page where the user needs to enter their credentials

- 3. After successfully authenticating the user, the SAML provider redirects the user to SAML Jackson. Step (2) and (3) follow the SAML protocol.

- 4. SAML Jackson redirects the user to the frontend app on the configured callback URL. The callback URL contains the one time use auth code.

- 5. SuperTokens' frontend SDK passes the one time use auth code to your app's backend.

- 6. SuperTokens' backend SDK verifies the auth code by querying SAML Jackson. On success, SAML Jackson returns the end user's information and access token.

- 7. SuperTokens' backend SDK creates a new user in the core associated with the end user's email. New session tokens are also created

- 8. A SuperTokens' session is established between your app's backend and frontend - logging in the user.
