# Run multiple apps on the same SuperTokens core

Like how you can create multiple tenants / user pools within one SuperTokens core, you can create multiple apps within one core as well:
- Each app is isolated and can have several tenants.
- Each app can have its own database, or share a database with another app (and yet be logically isolated).
- Each app can have its own set of [core and db configurations](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/config.yaml). If a specific configuration is not explicitly set for an app, it inherits it from the base config.yaml / docker environment variables configuration.
- The core and db configurations of each tenant within an app inherit from the configurations of that app.

You can use this feature to deploy one SuperTokens core across several independent apps within your company, or to create multiple environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod` etc.) for one app without deploying individual SuperTokens core instances.

## 1. Create a new / update an app in the core

:::caution
This is a paid feature, even if creating an additional development environment on the managed service, or if using `dev license keys` in case of self-hosting. The pricing is $50 / month / additional app. Please reach out to us at [support@supertokens.com](mailto:support@supertokens.com) if you have any questions, or if you want to create several `environments` and want a bulk discount.
:::

To create a new app in the SuperTokens core, you can use the following cURL command:

```bash
curl --location --request PUT '^{coreInfo.uri}/recipe/multitenancy/app/v2' \
--header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "appId": "app1",
    "coreConfig": {...}
}'
```

- The above command creates (or updates) an app with the `appId` of `app1`.
- It also creates a default tenant for this app with the tenant ID of `public` (that is, the default `tenantId`)
- You can set various core configurations for this app (see the config.yaml / docker environment variable options for your core). The core configurations for a new app inherit from the configurations provided in the config.yaml / docker environment (or the edit configuration dashboard for managed service).
- By default, all the login methods are enabled for a new app (specifically, the `public` tenant of the new app), but you can pass in `firstFactors` input to specifically enable selected login methods.

The built-in Factor IDs that can be used for `firstFactors` are:
- Email password auth: `emailpassword`
- Social login / enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) auth: `thirdparty`
- Passwordless:
    - With email One-Time Password (OTP): `otp-email`
    - With Short Message Service (SMS) OTP: `otp-phone`
    - With email magic link: `link-email`
    - With SMS magic link: `link-phone`

```bash
curl --location --request PUT '^{coreInfo.uri}/recipe/multitenancy/app' \
--header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "appId": "app1",
    "thirdPartyEnabled": true,
    "passwordlessEnabled": true,
    "emailPasswordEnabled": true,
    "coreConfig": {...}
}'
```

- The above command creates (or updates) an app with the `appId` of `app1`.
- It also creates a default tenant for this app with the tenant ID of `public` (that is, the default `tenantId`)
- You can set various core configurations for this app (see the config.yaml / docker environment variable options for your core). The core configurations for a new app inherit from the configurations provided in the config.yaml / docker environment (or the edit configuration dashboard for managed service).
- By default, all the login methods are enabled for a new app (specifically, the `public` tenant of the new app), but you can pass in `false` to any of the login methods specified above to disable them.

:::important
Even if a login method is enabled for a tenant, you still need to initialize the right recipe on the backend for sign up / sign in to be possible with that login method. For example, if for a tenant, you have enabled the passwordless login method, but don't use the passwordless (or a combination recipe that has passwordless) on the backend, then end users cannot sign up / sign in using the passwordless APIs because those APIs are not exposed via the backend SDK's middleware.

## 2. Configuring the App ID During Backend SDK Init

While one core can have multiple apps, you must use a dedicated backend (integrated with the backend SDK) per app. For example, if you have two apps, and both use a NodeJS backend, then you need to configure one app's backend to have `appId` as `app1` (as an example), and the other app's backend to have `appId` as `app2`. You can specify an `appId` on the backend SDK SuperTokens.init by appending the `appId` to the `connectionUri` as shown below:

<BackendTabs>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import supertokens from "supertokens-node";

supertokens.init({
    supertokens: {
        // highlight-next-line
        connectionURI: "http://localhost:3567/appid-app1",
    },
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: []
});
```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="go">

```go
import "github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/supertokens"

func main() {
	supertokens.Init(supertokens.TypeInput{
		Supertokens: &supertokens.ConnectionInfo{
            // highlight-next-line
			ConnectionURI: "http://localhost:3567/appid-app1",
		},
	})
}

```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="python">

```python
from supertokens_python import init, InputAppInfo, SupertokensConfig

init(
    app_info=InputAppInfo(api_domain="...", app_name="...", website_domain="..."),
    supertokens_config=SupertokensConfig(
        # highlight-next-line
        connection_uri='http://localhost:3567/appid-app1',
    ),
    framework='...', # type: ignore
    recipe_list=[
      #...
   ]
)
```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
</BackendTabs>

- In the above code snippet, the backend SDK is informed that the `appId` to use for this app is `app1`. You can pick your own app ID, but whatever it is, you need to add it as shown above.
- It is important to prefix the app ID with `appid-` as that enables the SuperTokens core to reliably detect the app that the query is for.
