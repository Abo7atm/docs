# Machine to Machine Authentication

## Overview

The recommended way to authenticate microservices with **SuperTokens** is by using the **OAuth2** specification.
You have to create an **OAuth2 Provider** and use the **OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow** for authorization.

## Prerequisites

<PaidFeatureCallout />

Before you can dive deeper in the functionality there are a few things to keep in mind: 
- The feature is available with the **SuperTokens Managed Service**.
It is not included in the **Self-Hosted** version.
- You can use it with the `Node.js` or the `Python` backend SDKs.

If you do not meet the previous requirements you can use the [legacy flow](/docs/authentication/m2m/legacy-flow).

## Getting started 

There are two separate quickstart guides that you can follow. 
The recommendation is to use the **Client Credentials Flow**.
The **Legacy Flow** guide is here for backwards compatibility and it will get deprecated in the future.

Before you explore a guide, read through the **OAuth2 Basics** page first.
It explains several concepts that get used in each tutorial.

## Authentication Steps 

:::info Caution

This is only supported by the **NodeJS** SDK.

:::

This flow uses common **OAuth2** terminology. If you want a short explanation on how **OAuth2** works and its concepts, please check out [this page](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-basics).

In the **Client Credentials Flow** the authentication sequence will work in the following way:

1. `Service A` uses credentials to get an **OAuth2 Access Token**
2. [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-server) returns the **OAuth2 Access Token**
3. `Service A` uses the **OAuth2 Access Token** to communicate with `Service B`
4. `Service B` validates the **OAuth2 Access Token**
5. If the token is valid `Service B` returns the requested resource

Check our [**extensive guide**](/docs/authentication/m2m/client-credentials) that will show you how to setup the **Authorization Service** and how to complete all the steps using **SuperTokens**.
