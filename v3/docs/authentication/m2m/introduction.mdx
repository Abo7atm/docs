# Machine to Machine Authentication

## Overview

The recommended way to authenticate microservices with **SuperTokens** is by using the **OAuth2** specification.
You have to create an **OAuth2 Provider** and use the **OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow** for authorization.

## Prerequisites

<PaidFeatureCallout />

Before you can dive deeper in the functionality there are a few things to keep in mind: 
- The feature is available with the **SuperTokens Managed Service**.
It is not included in the **Self-Hosted** version.
- You can use it with the `Node.js` or the `Python` backend SDKs.

If you do not meet the previous requirements you can use the [legacy flow](/docs/authentication/m2m/legacy-flow).

## Getting started 

There are two separate quickstart guides that you can follow. 
The recommendation is to use the **Client Credentials Flow**.
The **Legacy Flow** guide is here for backwards compatibility and it will get deprecated in the future.

Before you explore a guide, read through the **OAuth2 Basics** page first.
It explains several concepts that get used in each tutorial.
