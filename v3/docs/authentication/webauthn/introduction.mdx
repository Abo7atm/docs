# Introduction

## Overview

WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a modern authentication standard that enables passwordless authentication using biometric sensors (like fingerprint readers or facial recognition) or security keys (like YubiKeys). This feature allows your users to authenticate without passwords, providing both enhanced security and improved user experience.

## Why to use WebAuthn

- Provides superior security compared to traditional passwords by using cryptographic authentication
- Offers a seamless user experience with biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition)
- Eliminates phishing attacks since credentials are bound to the origin
- Reduces account takeover risks and password-related vulnerabilities
- Helps meet regulatory compliance requirements for strong authentication
- Lowers support costs by eliminating password resets

## What are Passkeys?

Passkeys are a user-friendly implementation of WebAuthn credentials that make passwordless authentication more accessible. They represent the next evolution in authentication, backed by major platform providers like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Key aspects of passkeys include:

- **Syncing Across Devices**: Unlike traditional WebAuthn credentials that are device-specific, passkeys can sync across a user's devices through their platform account (iCloud, Google account, etc.)

- **Platform Integration**: Passkeys are deeply integrated into operating systems and browsers, providing a seamless experience across different platforms and devices

- **Enhanced Security**: 
  - End-to-end encryption during syncing
  - Phishing-resistant by design
  - Based on public key cryptography
  - Protected by biometric authentication or device PIN

- **Improved User Experience**:
  - No passwords to remember
  - Automatic syncing between devices
  - Quick and easy authentication using biometrics
  - Familiar system UI for authentication

While passkeys and WebAuthn credentials share the same underlying technology, passkeys add the convenience of cross-device availability while maintaining the strong security guarantees of WebAuthn.

## Terminology

Before diving into WebAuthn implementation, it's important to understand the key terminology used throughout this documentation. WebAuthn introduces several new technical concepts and terms that may be unfamiliar to developers. This section will help you better understand the documentation and the WebAuthn specification.

For a more detailed explanation of the WebAuthn specification, you can refer to the [WebAuthn specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/).

Note: Throughout our documentation, the terms "passkey" and "credential" are used interchangeably, though they have subtle technical differences explained below.

- **Passkey**: A user-friendly term for WebAuthn credentials that are synced across a user's devices. Passkeys are:
  - More convenient than traditional credentials as they sync automatically
  - Backed by platform providers like Apple, Google, and Microsoft
  - Protected by end-to-end encryption during syncing

- **Credential**: The technical term for the cryptographic key pairs used in WebAuthn. Unlike passkeys:
  - Credentials are device-specific and not synced
  - They represent the raw cryptographic material
  - Multiple credentials can be part of a single passkey

- **Authenticator**: A device or software that implements WebAuthn authentication. This can be:
  - **Platform Authenticator**: Built-in biometric sensors like TouchID, FaceID, or Windows Hello
  - **Roaming Authenticator**: External security devices like YubiKeys or Google Titan keys

- **Registration**: The process where a user registers their authenticator with your application. During this process:
  - The server generates a challenge for the authenticator to sign
  - The authenticator creates a new credential
  - The public key and other metadata are saved to your database

- **Authentication**: The process where a user proves their identity using their authenticator by:
  - Responding to a server challenge
  - Using their private key to sign the challenge
  - The server verifying the signature with the stored public key

- **Attestation**: Information about the authenticator device itself, which can be used to verify the authenticator's authenticity and security level.

- **User Verification**: The method used to verify the user's presence, which can be:
  - Biometric verification (fingerprint, face scan)
  - PIN entry
  - Physical button press on a security key


## Feature Overview

The WebAuthn feature in SuperTokens provides:

- Complete implementation of the WebAuthn standard
- Support for platform authenticators (biometric sensors) and roaming authenticators (security keys)
- Automatic handling of device registration and authentication
- Integration with other SuperTokens features
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Integration Options

You can implement WebAuthn in your application in several ways:

1. **Standalone WebAuthn**: Use WebAuthn as the primary authentication method
2. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Add WebAuthn as a second factor alongside passwords
3. **Hybrid Setup**: Combine WebAuthn with other authentication methods like passwordless/magic links

## Prerequisites

Before implementing WebAuthn, ensure:

- Your application runs on HTTPS (required for WebAuthn)
- Your users have compatible devices with either:
  - Built-in biometric sensors (TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello)
  - External security keys (YubiKey, Google Titan)
- Your backend can handle the WebAuthn protocol
