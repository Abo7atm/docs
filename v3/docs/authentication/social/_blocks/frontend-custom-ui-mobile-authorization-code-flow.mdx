### Sign in with Apple example

<MobileFrameworksCard>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="reactnative">

#### Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend

For react native apps, this involves setting up the [react-native-apple-authentication library](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication) in your app. Checkout their `README` for steps on how to integrate their SDK into your application. The minimum scope required by SuperTokens is the one that gives the user's email (In case of Apple, that could be the user's actual email or the proxy email provided by Apple - it doesn't really matter).

Once the integration is done, you should call the `appleAuth.performRequest` function for iOS and the `appleAuthAndroid.signIn` function for Android. Either way, the result of the function will be a one time use auth code which you should send to your backend as shown in the next step.

A full example of this can be found in [our example app](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native/blob/master/examples/with-thirdparty/apple.ts).

In case you are using Expo, you can use the [expo-apple-authentication](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/apple-authentication/) library instead (not that this library only works on iOS).

#### Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend

For iOS you use the normal sign in with apple flow and then use the authorization code to login with SuperTokens. You can see a full example of this in the `onAppleClicked` function in [our example app](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-ios/blob/master/examples/with-thirdparty/with-thirdparty/LoginScreen/LoginScreenViewController.swift).

```swift
import UIKit
import AuthenticationServices

fileprivate class ViewController: UIViewController, ASAuthorizationControllerPresentationContextProviding, ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate {
    func presentationAnchor(for controller: ASAuthorizationController) -> ASPresentationAnchor {
        return view.window!
    }

    func loginWithApple() {
        let authorizationRequest = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider().createRequest()
        authorizationRequest.requestedScopes = [.email, .fullName]
        
        let authorizationController = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [authorizationRequest])
        
        authorizationController.presentationContextProvider = self
        authorizationController.delegate = self
        authorizationController.performRequests()
    }
    
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
        guard let credential: ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential = authorization.credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential,
            let authorizationCode = credential.authorizationCode,
            let authorizationCodeString: String = String(data: authorizationCode, encoding: .utf8),
            let email: String = credential.email as? String,
            let nameComponents: PersonNameComponents = credential.fullName as? PersonNameComponents,
            let firstName: String = nameComponents.givenName as? String,
            let lastName: String = nameComponents.familyName as? String else {return}
        
        // Send the user information and auth code to the backend. Refer to the next step.

#### Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend

For flutter we use the [sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) package, make sure to follow the prerequisites steps to get the package setup. After setup use the snippet below to trigger the apple sign in flow. You can see a full example of this in the `loginWithApple` function in [our example app](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-flutter/blob/master/examples/with-thirdparty/lib/screens/login.dart).

```dart
import 'package:sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple.dart';

void loginWithApple() async {
  try {
    var credential = await SignInWithApple.getAppleIDCredential(
        scopes: [
            AppleIDAuthorizationScopes.email,
            AppleIDAuthorizationScopes.fullName,
        ],
        // Required for Android only
        webAuthenticationOptions: WebAuthenticationOptions(
            clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
            redirectUri: Uri.parse(
            "<API_DOMAIN>/<API_BASE_PATH>/callback/apple",
            ),
        ),
    );

    String authorizationCode = credential.authorizationCode;
    String? idToken = credential.identityToken;
    String? email = credential.email;
    String? firstname = credential.givenName;
    String? lastName = credential.familyName;

    // Send the user information and auth code to the backend. Refer to the next step.
  } catch (e) {
    // Sign in aborted or failed
  }
}
```

In the snippet above for Android we need to pass an additional `webAuthenticationOptions` property when signing in with Apple. This is because on Android the library uses the web login flow and we need to provide it with the client id and redirection uri. The `redirectUri` property here is the URL to which Apple will make a `POST` request after the user has logged in. The SuperTokens backend SDKs provide an API for this at `<API_DOMAIN>/<API_BASE_PATH>/callback/apple`.

#### Additional steps for Android 

For android we also need to provide a way for the web login flow to redirect back to the app. By default the API provided by the backend SDKs redirect to the website domain you provide when initialising the SDK, we can override the API to have it redirect to our app instead. For example if you were using the Node.js SDK:

In the code above we override the `appleRedirectHandlerPOST` API to check if the request was made by our Android app (You can skip checking the state if you only have a mobile app and no website). `sign_in_with_apple` requires us to parse the query params sent by apple and include them in the redirect URL in a specific way, and then we simply redirect to the deep link url. Refer to the README for `sign_in_with_apple` to read about the deep link setup required in Android.

#### Calling the `signinup` API to consume the authorisation token

<AppInfoForm />

Once you have the authorisation code from the auth provider, you need to call the `/signinup` API exposed by our backend SDK as shown below:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "thirdPartyId": "apple",
    "clientType": "...",
    "redirectURIInfo": {
        "redirectURIOnProviderDashboard": "^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/callback/apple",
        "redirectURIQueryParams": {
            "code": "...",
            "user": {
                "name":{
                    "firstName":"...",
                    "lastName":"..."
                },
                "email":"..."
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

:::important
- On iOS, the client id set in the backend should be the same as the bundle identifier for your app.
- The `clientType` input is optional, and is required only if you have initialised more than one client in the provide on the backend (See the "Social / SSO login for both, web and mobile apps" section below).
- On iOS, `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` doesn't matter and its value can be a universal link configured for your app.
- On Android, the `redirectURIOnProviderDashboard` should match the one configured on the Apple developer dashboard.
- The `user` object contains information provided by Apple.
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user.
- `status: "NO_EMAIL_GIVEN_BY_PROVIDER"`: This is returned if the social / SSO provider did not provider an email for the user. In this case, you want to ask the user to pick another method of sign in. Or, you can also override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user for this provider.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during MFA. The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in / up was not allowed.

:::note
On success, the backend will send back session tokens as part of the response headers which will be automatically handled by our frontend SDK for you.

### Sign in with Google Example

<MobileFrameworksCard>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="reactnative">

#### Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend

This involves setting up the [@react-native-google-signin/google-signin](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin) in your app. Checkout their `README` for steps on how to integrate their SDK into your application. The minimum scope required by SuperTokens is the one that gives the user's email.

Once the library is set up, use `GoogleSignin.configure` and  `GoogleSignin.signIn` to trigger the login flow and sign the user in with Google. Refer to [our example app](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native/blob/master/examples/with-thirdparty/google.ts) to see the full code for this.

```tsx
import { GoogleSignin } from "@react-native-google-signin/google-signin";

export const performGoogleSignIn = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  GoogleSignin.configure({
    webClientId: "GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID",
    iosClientId: "GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID",
  });

  try {
    const user = await GoogleSignin.signIn({});
    const authCode = user.serverAuthCode;

    // Refer to step 2

    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Google sign in failed with error", e);
  }

  return false;

### Authorization Code Grant flow with PKCE

This is similar to the first one, except that you do **not** need to provide a client secret during backend init.
This flow only works for providers which support the [PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

<MobileFrameworksCard>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="reactnative">

#### Fetching the authorisation token on the frontend

You can use the [react native auth library](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth) to also return the PKCE code verifier along with the authorization code. This can be done by setting the `usePKCE` boolean to `true` and also by setting the `skipCodeExchange` to `true` when configuring the react native auth library.

- Replace `THIRD_PARTY_ID` with the provider id. The provider id must match the one you configure in the backend when initialising SuperTokens.
- `REDIRECT_URI` must exactly match the value you configure on the providers dashboard.
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user.
- `status: "NO_EMAIL_GIVEN_BY_PROVIDER"`: This is returned if the social / SSO provider did not provider an email for the user. In this case, you want to ask the user to pick another method of sign in. Or, you can also override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user for this provider.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during MFA. The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in / up was not allowed.

:::note
On success, the backend will send back session tokens as part of the response headers which will be automatically handled by our frontend SDK for you.
