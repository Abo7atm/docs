# Multi Tenancy

<PaidFeatureCallout />

If you are using a **Multi-Tenant** configuration and you are also implementing your own **custom UI**, you will have to add a tenant discovery process in your authentication flow.
This information is discussed at large in different pages of the documentation. Follow a specific guide, based on the authentication method that you are using, for more information:

- [Email/Password](/docs/authentication/email-password/introduction)
- [Passwordless](/docs/authentication/passwordless/introduction)
- [Third Party](/docs/authentication/social/introduction)

One thing to point out here, in the context of **OAuth2**, is that you will have to account for **Clients** passing information about which tenant is being used.
This is done through the the authorization URL, in the `tenant_id` query parameter.
The login page must handle the **tenant ID** and ensure it's being passed across different authentication pages through the URL.
