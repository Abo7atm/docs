# Implement a Custom UI

<PaidFeatureCallout />

This guide will show you how to implement the **Unified Login** functionalities using your own custom UI.

:::info

The following instructions assume that you already have a custom UI setup in your current project.

If you have skipped this step, please check our [guides](/docs/quickstart/frontend-setup) based on the authentication methods that you want to use.

:::

Before going into the actual instructions we should first recap how the **OAuth2** login flow will work. 
This way we will have an easier time understanding what we are doing.

#### 1. A user accesses your application and tries to login.

It's up to you how you want to handle this. 
They can click a button to login or you can directly start the login flow.

#### 2. They get redirected to the **Authorization Service Backend** 

This action can be done by a **OAuth2/OIDC** library.
Check the previous guides for information on what you could use.

#### 3. The **Authorization Service Backend** redirects them to the **Authorization Service Frontend** login page.

The page URL will contain a `loginChallenge` parameter that will keep track of the login attempt.
Besides that, the URL can also include a `forceFreshAuth` parameter.
As the name suggests, this should force the login UI to be visible even though the user has an existing valid session.
We will show you how to handle this in the actual guide.

#### 4. The **Authorization Service Frontend** renders the login UI and the user performs the login action.

The login UI should render based on instructions that are specific to each authentication method which you are using.
The additional thing that you have to do here is to take into account the `forceFreshAuth` parameter. 

#### 5. The **Authorization Service Frontend** redirects the user back to the **Authorization Service Backend** 

After the user submits the login form you will have to redirect them to a specific route that will send them to the original application.
From here the authentication flow can be considered finalized.

Now let's see how we can actually implement this UI.

## 1. Configure the Redirection URLs

<AppInfoForm />

As we have hinted in the previous section, the **Authorization Service Backend** sends the user to different pages from the **Authorization Service Frontend**, based on the action that needs to be made.

The default values for these routes are:

- The login page is mapped to `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}` (this is also the place where a user ends up after logout)
- The token refresh page is mapped to `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}/try-refresh`
- The logout page is mapped to `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}/logout`

If you want to change these routes you will have to add a custom override.

:::info
This override needs to be added to the **Authorization Service Backend**.

                        loginChallenge: input.loginChallenge,

                        queryParams.set("forceFreshAuth", "true");
                    }

                    return `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}?${queryParams.toString()}`;
                } else if (input.type === "try-refresh") {
                    return `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}/try-refresh?loginChallenge=${input.loginChallenge}`;
                } else if (input.type === "post-logout-fallback") {
                    return `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}`;
                } else if (input.type === "logout-confirmation") {
                    return `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}/oauth/logout?logoutChallenge=${input.logoutChallenge}`;
                }

                return `^{appInfo.websiteDomain}^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}`;
            },
        }),
    },
})

## 2. Handle the forceFreshAuth parameter

In some cases, even though there is an existing valid session in the **Authorization Service Frontend**, the requesting **Client** might force a new login attempt.
This is signaled by the `forceFreshAuth` parameter.

When the login page is rendered you will also have to check for this parameter. You are doing this to know if you need to show the login UI.

Here is an example of how you can evaluate this case.

```tsx
import Session from 'supertokens-web-js/recipe/session';

async function shouldLogin() {
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const forceFreshAuth = urlParams.get('forceFreshAuth') as string;
  if(forceFreshAuth === "true") return true;

  return Session.doesSessionExist();
}

```

:::info Multi Tenancy

If you are using multi tenancy, you will also have to keep track of the `tenantId` query parameter and pass it between the **Authorization Service Frontend** pages.

:::

## 3. Complete the Login Attempt
  

After the user will submit the login form you will have to redirect them to a specific route in order to complete the **OAuth 2** flow.

The following code sample shows you how to determine which URL to use.

<FrontendCustomUITabs uiType="custom">

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

```tsx
import OAuth2Provider from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/oauth2provider";

async function getInitialRedirectionURL() {
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const loginChallenge = urlParams.get('loginChallenge') as string;
  const redirectionResponse = await OAuth2Provider.getRedirectURLToContinueOAuthFlow({ loginChallenge });
  if (redirectionResponse.status === "OK") {
    return redirectionResponse.frontendRedirectTo;
  }
}

```

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="mobile">

:::caution

For mobile apps you will have to reuse the web authentication flow. Check this [guide](/docs/authentication/unified-login/reuse-website-login) for more information.

## 4. Add the Token Refresh Page

In order to have support for token refreshing you will need to add a new page to your application.
The path should correspond to the one that was outlined during the first step.

When the user ends up on this page, you will have to use the `Session` recipe to perform the refresh action.
Then they need to be redirected to a page from your application.

Here's a code sample that shows you how to do this.

<FrontendCustomUITabs uiType="custom">

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

```tsx
import OAuth2Provider from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/oauth2provider";
import Session from 'supertokens-web-js/recipe/session';

async function refreshToken() {
  await Session.attemptRefreshingSession();
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const loginChallenge = urlParams.get('loginChallenge') as string;
  const redirectionResponse = await OAuth2Provider.getRedirectURLToContinueOAuthFlow({ loginChallenge });
  if (redirectionResponse.status === "OK") {
    window.location.href = redirectionResponse.frontendRedirectTo;
  }
}

```

## 4. Add the Logout Page 

You will need to add a logout page that will be accessed when a user wants to end their session. 
The path should correspond to the one that was outlined during the first step.

The logout action should first ask the user for confirmation.
If the confirmation is passed then you can call the recipe function.
Based on the final response you can redirect the user to the provided redirection URL.

<FrontendCustomUITabs uiType="custom">

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

```tsx
import OAuth2Provider from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/oauth2provider";

async function logout() {
  const confirmation = confirm("Are you sure that you want to log out?");
  if(!confirmation) return;

  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const logoutChallenge = urlParams.get('logoutChallenge') as string;
  const redirectResponse = await OAuth2Provider.logOut({ logoutChallenge });
  window.location.href = redirectResponse.frontendRedirectTo;
}
```
