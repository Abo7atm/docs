# Reuse website login for desktop and mobile apps

<PaidFeatureCallout />

This pattern is useful if you want to have the same web authentication experience for your desktop and mobile apps.
The flow will allow you to save development time but you will have to keep in mind that it will not involve a native authentication interface.
Users will be directed to a separate browser page where they will complete the authentication flow.

The authentication flow will work in the following way:

1. User accesses the native application
2. The user gets redirected to [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-service) authentication url.
3. The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-service) redirects the user to the login UI
4. User completes the login attempt 
5. The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-service) backend redirects the user to the `callback URL`.
This URL should be a deep link that can be opened by your actual application.
6. The application uses the callback URL information to request a **OAuth2 Access Token** from the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-service).
7. The returned token is saved by the application.

:::info
This guide assumes that you already have setup and configured **SuperTokens** in your [**Authentication Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authentication-service). 

For more information on how to do that please check our [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/introduction).
:::

## 1. Enable the OAuth2 features from the Dashboard

You will first have to enable the **OAuth2** features from the **SuperTokens.com Dashboard**.
1. Open the **SuperTokens.com Dashboard**
2. Click on the **Enabled Paid Features** button
3. Click on **Managed Service**
4. Check the **OAuth 2.0** option
5. Click *Save* 

Now you should be able to use the OAuth2 recipes in your applications.

## 2. Create the OAuth2 Clients

<AppInfoForm />

For each of your **`applications`** you will have to create a separate [**OAuth2 Client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#client).
This can be done by directly calling the **SuperTokens Core** API.

```bash
# You will have to run this for each one of your applications
# Adjust the client_name and redirect_uri based on that
curl -X POST ^{coreInfo.uri}/recipe/oauth2/admin/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}" \
  -d '{
      "clientName": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
      "responseTypes": ["code", "id_token"],
      "grantTypes": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
      "tokenEndpointAuthMethod": "none",
      "scope": "offline_access <custom_scope_1> <custom_scope_2>",
      "redirectUri": ["https://<YOUR_APPLICATION_DOMAIN>/oauth/callback"]
    }'
```

- `clientName` - A human-readable name of the client that will be used for identification.
- `responseTypes` - Specifies the types of responses your client expects from the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-server). Most of the time, you would need the following two to be present:
    - `code`: Indicates that the [**Client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#client) will receive an **Authorization Code** that will be exchanged for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
    - `id_token`: Indicates that the [**Client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#client) expects an [**ID Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#id-token)
- `grantTypes` - The grant types that the [**Client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#client) will use. 
    - `authorization_code`: Allows exchanging the **Authorization Code** for an [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
    - `refresh_token`: Allows exchanging the [**OAuth2 Refresh Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-refresh-token) for a new [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-access-token).
- `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` - Indicates that the process of obtaining an **OAuth2 Access Token** will not make use of the client secret 
- `redirectUri` - A list of URIs to which the [**Authorization Server**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-server) will send the user-agent (browser) after completing the authorization step. These can be deep links to mobile or desktop apps as well, but they must be exact URLs, without wildcards.
- `scope` -  A space separated string of scopes that the [**Client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#client) will request access to.
    - `offline_access`: You need to include this scope if you want to use the [**OAuth2 Refresh Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-refresh-token) to get a new [**OAuth2 Access Token**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-access-token).

If the creation was successful, the API will return a response that looks like this:

```json

{
    "clientName": "<YOUR_CLIENT_NAME>",
    "clientId": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "callbackUrls": ["https://<YOUR_APPLICATION_DOMAIN>/oauth/callback"],
}

```

Based on the client creation process we can also infer two additional values that we will need later on:
- `authorizeUrl` corresponds to `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/oauth/auth`
- `tokenFetchUrl` corresponds to `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/oauth/token`

:::caution

You will have to save this response because we do not persist it internally for security reasons.
In the next steps we will use the values to complete several configurations.

:::

### Change the default token lifespan

By default, the tokens used in the authorization flow will have the following lifespans:
  - [OAuth2 Access Token](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-access-token): 1 hour
  - [OAuth2 ID Token](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-id-token): 1 hour
  - [OAuth2 Refresh Token](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#oauth2-refresh-token): 30 days

If you want to change the default values you need to specify additional properties in the [**Client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#client) creation request body.
Use string values that signify time duration in milliecoseconds, seconds, minutes or hours (e.g. `"2000ms"`, `"60s"`, `"30m"`, `"1h"`).
There are no limits on the duration of each token.

- **OAuth2 Access Token** - Set the `authorizationCodeGrantAccessTokenLifespan` property.
- **OAuth2 ID Token** - Set the `authorizationCodeGrantIdTokenLifespan` property.
- **OAuth2 Refresh Token** - Set both the `authorizationCodeGrantRefreshTokenLifespan` and the `refreshTokenGrantRefreshTokenLifespan` properties to the same value.

## 3. Make sure that you have properly configured the Authorization Service

If you have not set up the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/introduction#authorization-service) yet, please check one of the previous guides based whether you use multiple backend service:
- [Single Backend Setup](/docs/authentication/unified-login/use-cases/multiple-frontends-with-a-single-backend#3-set-up-your-authorization-service-backend)
- [Multiple Backends Setup](/docs/authentication/unified-login/use-cases/multiple-frontends-with-separate-backends#3-set-up-your-authorization-service)

## 4. Update the login flow in your applications

In each of your individual `applications` you will have to setup up logic for handling the **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow.
We recommend using a generic **OICD** or **OAuth** library in order to do this.

<MobileFrameworksCard>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="reactnative">

<MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

You can use the [react-native-app-auth](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-app-auth/) library. 
Just follow [the instructions](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-app-auth/docs/usage/config) to setup your application. 

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `issuer` corresponds to the endpoint of the **Authorization Service** `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}`
- `clientID` corresponds to `clientId`
- `redirectUrl` corresponds a value from `callbackUrls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 

You will also need to set the `additionalParameters` property with the following values:
- `max_age: 0` This will force a new authentication flow once the user ends up on the **Authorization Service** frontend.
- `tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>` Optional, in case you are using a multi tenant setup. Set this to the actual tenant ID.

</MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

</MobileFrameworksCard.Content>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="android">

<MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

You can use the [AppAuth-Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) library. 
Just follow [the instructions](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android?tab=readme-ov-file#authorization-service-configuration) to setup your application. 

The configuration parameters can be determined based on the response that we received on **step 2**, when we created the **OAuth2 Client**.

For the `AuthorizationServiceConfiguration` the parameters that you will have to provide are: `authorizeUrl` and `tokenFetchUrl`.
When calling the `AuthorizationRequest.Builder` function you can use `clientId` and a value from `callbackUrls` to replace the example values.

You will need to set additional query parameters by calling the `setAdditionalParameters` function on the `AuthorizationRequest.Builder` object:
- `max_age: 0` This will force a new authentication flow once the user ends up on the **Authorization Service** frontend.
- `tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>` Optional, in case you are using a multi tenant setup. Set this to the actual tenant ID.

## 5. Test the new authentication flow

With everything set up, you can now test your login flow.
Just use the setup that you have created in the previous step to check if the authentication flow completes without any issues.
