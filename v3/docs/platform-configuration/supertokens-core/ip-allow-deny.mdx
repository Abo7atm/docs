# Allow / Deny requests based on IP address

You can set the SuperTokens core's config such that it accepts / denies requests that originate from certain IPs. This can be used to make sure that only your backend is able to query the SuperTokens core - increasing the security.

## Allowing requests that have certain IP addresses

<SelfHostingTabs>
<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
 docker run \
    -p 3567:3567 \
    // highlight-next-line
    -e IP_ALLOW_REGEX="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" \ 
    -d registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name>
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>

<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="without-docker">

```yaml
# You need to add the following to the config.yaml file.
# The file path can be found by running the "supertokens --help" command

ip_allow_regex: 127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above will only allow requests that originate from an IP that matches `127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1` regular expression. A breakdown of this regex is:
- `127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+`: IPs that start with `127.`; OR
- `::1`: IPv6 from localhost; OR
- `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`: IPv6 from localhost

In this way, we allow requests only from localhost and for other requests, the core will return a `403` status code. If instead you want to allow a list of IP addresses that correspond to your backend server's IP address, you can set this value to `IP1|IP2|IP3...` - for example: `100.12.12.3|192.167.4.3|50.32.5.1`.

If this value is not set, then the core will allow requests from any IP address.

## Denying requests that have certain IP addresses

This is the opposite of the above config. If you only set this, the core will allow requests from any IP other than the one that matches the regular expression corresponding to this setting.

<SelfHostingTabs>
<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
 docker run \
    -p 3567:3567 \
    // highlight-next-line
    -e IP_DENY_REGEX="100.1.1.3" \ 
    -d registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name>
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>

<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="without-docker">

```yaml
# You need to add the following to the config.yaml file.
# The file path can be found by running the "supertokens --help" command

ip_deny_regex: 100.1.1.3
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above setting will make the core accept requests from any IP other than `100.1.1.3`. For `100.1.1.3`, it will return a `403`.

## What if both the configs are set?

In this case, the core will allow requests only based on the value of `ip_allow_regex`, as long that request's IP doesn't match the regex of `ip_deny_regex`. For example, if you set `ip_allow_regex: IP1|IP2` and `ip_deny_regex: IP1`, then the core will accept requests only from `IP2`.
