# Method 1. Default service

If you provide no configuration for email delivery, the backend SDK sends emails by talking to our servers on `https://api.supertokens.com` (for both self hosted and managed versions). This requires no setup from your side and can be used in production.

You can see the default email UI here:
- Default [email verification template](../common-customizations/email-verification/email-verification-email) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/email-verification.html).
- Default [password reset template](../common-customizations/reset-password/password-reset-email) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/password-reset.html).

:::important

- Emails are sent using `noreply@supertokens.io` email ID. If you want to use your own domain, please see one of the other methods in this section.
- You cannot customise the email template when using this method. If you want to customise the emails, please see one of the other methods in this section.
- Emails sent via our service is free and may land up in user's spam due to the high number of apps that use our service. If you want to avoid this, we recommend using one of the other methods mentioned in this section.
