# Method 1. Default service

If you provide no configuration for SMS delivery, the backend SDK sends SMSs by talking to our servers on `https://api.supertokens.com` (for both self hosted and managed versions). This requires no setup from your side.

You can see the default SMS content:
- Default [passwordless login with OTP template](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#otp-login-1).

- Default [passwordless login with magic link template](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#magic-link-login-1).

- Default [passwordless login with magic link and OTP template](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates#magic-link--otp-login-1).

:::info Important
- This is a free service and is globally rate limited. So this is not suitable for production use. If you do not receive an SMS using this method, then the SDK will print the SMS content on the terminal.
- We do not log / store any of the info sent to our API that send out emails on behalf of your app.
- You cannot customise the SMS content when using this method. If you want to customise the content, please see one of the other methods in this section.
