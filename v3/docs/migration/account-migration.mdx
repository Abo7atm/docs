# Account Migration 

<DescriptionText>
  To following guide will show how you can move your users from your current authentication solution to **SuperTokens**
</DescriptionText>

<Separator />

## Overview

The process of migrating your existing accounts can be broken down into two parts:

### The initial bulk import

This is where you will be importing most of your users through the **SuperTokens** bulk import API.
The process is async and can work with large amounts of data.

### The lazy migration of new users

If new users get created through your previous authentication provider after you have exported the existing accounts, you will have to add the new ones one by one.
To do this, we expose an API that allows you to create new users, in **SuperTokens**, when they sign up using your old flow.


## Migration Steps

### 1. Add the lazy migration flow

You will have to call the lazy migration API when a new user signs up using your previous authentication provider.
This will create a new account in **SuperTokens**, based on the information provided in the request body

<HTTPRequestCard path="/bulk-import/import" method="post" title="Import User">
  <HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{coreInfo.uri}/bulk-import/import' \
     --header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     --data'{
    "externalUserId": "<EXTERNAL_ID>",
    "userMetadata": {},
    "userRoles": [],
    "totpDevices": [],
    "loginMethods": []
}
```
  </HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
  <HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
<BulkImportUser />
  </HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
</HTTPRequestCard>

:::info
If your application does not have a sign up process or if new users are created manually you can skip this step
:::

### 2. Export the accounts from your current authentication provider

Export the users from your previous authentication provider and adjust the data to match the request body schema used in the previous step.
 
### 3. Perform the bulk migration process

#### 3.1 Add the accounts that should be imported

Using the data that you have generated in the previous step, you will have to call the `add-users` endpoint.
This step stages the data that will be imported later on by the background job.

Keep in mind that the endpoint has a limit 10000 users per request.


<HTTPRequestCard path="/bulk-import/import/add-users" method="post" title="Add Users for Bulk Import">
  <HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{coreInfo.uri}/bulk-import/add-users' \
     --header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     --data-raw '{
    users: [
      {
        "externalUserId": "<EXTERNAL_ID>",
        "userMetadata": {},
        "userRoles": [],
        "totpDevices": [],
        "loginMethods": []
      }
  ]
}
```
  </HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
  <HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
<BulkImportUser />
  </HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
</HTTPRequestCard>

:::info The Bulk Import Cron Job

Every 5 minutes the **SuperTokens** core service will run a cron job that goes through the staged users and tries to import them.
If a user gets imported successfully it will get removed from the staged list.
:::


#### 3.2 Monitor the progress of the job

In order to determine if all the users have been processed by the import flow you can call the `count users` API.

Before doing that, let's first understand the different states in which a staged user can be.
During the import process, the user can have one of the following statuses:
- **NEW**: The user has not yet been picked up by the import process.
- **PROCESSING**: The import process has selected the user for import.
- **FAILED**: The import process has failed for that user.

If a user gets imported successfully it will then be removed from the staged list. Hence, no status is needed for that state.

With this new information let's get back to the `count users` endpoint.
The request does just that. 
It counts the users that are staged for import. 
You can pass it a status filter as a query parameter (eg. `status=NEW`) to count only the users with that status.

Given that information, in order to check if your import is finalized you should do the following:
1. Call the `count users` API once without any filters. If the count is 0, then you can consider the import process as done.
2. If the count is not 0, then check if you still have rows that are getting processed (`status=PROCESSING`) or if there are rows that have not yet been picked up by the import job (`status=NEW`)
3. If the only rows that are left are the ones with the `FAILED` status, then you can proceed to step `3.3` where we explain how to debug those issues.


<HTTPRequestCard path="/bulk-import/users/count" method="get" title="Count Staged Users">
  <HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
```bash
  curl --location --request GET '^{coreInfo.uri}/bulk-import/users/count' \
     --header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
```
  </HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
  <HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
<BulkImportUser />
  </HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
</HTTPRequestCard>


#### 3.3 Handle staged users that failed to import 

You will have to go through this step only if you have staged users that failed to import.
This can happen for a number of reasons. Some of the most common reasons are:
- `Email` / `phoneNumber` already exists
- `externalUserId` is being already used by other user
- A primary user already exists for the email but with a different login method

If at the end of the previous step you have determined that you have staged users that failed to import you can debug the issues with the `get users` API.

<HTTPRequestCard path="/bulk-import/users" method="get" title="Get Staged Users">
  <HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
```bash
curl --location --request GET '^{coreInfo.uri}/bulk-import/users?status=FAILED' \
     --header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
```
  </HTTPRequestCard.ShellExample>
<HTTPRequestCard.NodeJSExample>
```tsx
const BASE_URL = '<CORE_API_ENDPOINT>';
const API_KEY = '<YOUR_API_KEY>';

const url = `${BASE_URL}/bulk-import/users?status=FAILED`;
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'api-key': API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
  },
}

fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

</HTTPRequestCard.NodeJSExample>
  <HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>

**Response Shape**

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "<string>",
      "raw_data": {},
      "status": null | "NEW" | "PROCESSING" | "FAILED",
      "error_msg": [<string>],
    }
  ],
  "nextPaginationToken": "<string>"
}
```
  </HTTPRequestCard.DetailsModal>
</HTTPRequestCard>



The response will include the import error messages for each specific user.
Use them to determine what needs to be corrected in your import data.
After you have fixed the issues you can then run the process again, from step `3.1`, only for the corrected data.


If you all your data has been imported correctly when can now consider the account migration process as done.

:::success You have successfully migrated your accounts

Now that you have completed the user migration process when can go on to the [next step](/docs/migration/session-migration).
There you will see how you can move your active sessions from your previous authentication provider to **SuperTokens**.
