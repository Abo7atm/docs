# Migrating Guide

<DescriptionText>
  To following guides will cover how you can move your authentication data from your current authentication solution to **SuperTokens** 
</DescriptionText>

<Separator />

## Before You Start

The migration steps are intended to be executed after you have configured your [initial **SuperTokens** integration](/docs/quickstart/introduction).
Hence, in order to complete any of the next instructions you will need the following:
- An existing application that has **SuperTokens** configured as an authentication solution. You can follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/introduction) for instructions on how to achieve this.
- A **SuperTokens** managed service account or a self-hosted **SuperTokens Core** instance.
More specifically, you will have to make HTTP requests to your `CORE_API_ENDPOINT` using an `API_KEY`. 


## Migration Steps

The entire migration process can be broken down into two steps.
Both are required in order to achieve a seamless transition process. 

1. [**Account Migration**](/docs/migration/account-migration/)

This is the main part of the migration flow.
In here you will be importing your users, together with their account credentials, from the current authentication provider into **SuperTokens**.

2. [**Session Migration**](/docs/migration/session-migration)

This step helps you to prevent any users with active sessions from experiencing authentication issues.
You will have to perform a series of steps so that any users that still use your previous authentication provider get switched to **SuperTokens**.
