## Before You Start

The migration steps are intended to be executed after you have configured your initial **SuperTokens** integration.
Hence, in order to complete any of the next instructions you will need the following:
- A **SuperTokens** managed service account or a self-hosted **SuperTokens Core** instance
More specifically, you will have to make HTTP requests to your `CORE_API_ENDPOINT` using an `API_KEY`. These can be found in some place
- An existing application that has **SuperTokens** configured as an authentication solution. You can follow the quickstart guide for instructions on how to achieve this.


## Migration Steps

The entire migration process can be broken down into two steps.
Bothare required in order to achieve a seamless transition process. 

1. [**Account Migration**](/docs/migration/account-migration/overview)

This is the main part of the migration flow.
In here you will be importing your users, together with their account credentials, from the current authentication provider into **SuperTokens**.

2. [**Session Migration**](/docs/migration/session-migration)

This step helps you to prevent any users with active sessions from experiencing authentication issues.
You will have to perform a series of steps so that any users that still use your previous authentication provider get switched to **SuperTokens**.
