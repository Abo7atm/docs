<Answer title="Yes">

You need to now setup an instance of the SuperTokens core for your app (that your backend should connect to). You have two options:
- [Managed service](/docs/quickstart/next-steps#configure-the-core-service)
- Self hosted with your own database ([With Docker](/docs/deployment/self-hosting/with-docker) or [Without Docker](/docs/deployment/self-hosting/without-docker))
