## Setting up the core and database

<Answer title="Yes">

You need to now setup an instance of the SuperTokens core for your app (that your backend should connect to). You have two options:
- [Managed service](../../quick-setup/core/saas-setup)
- Self hosted with your own database ([With Docker](../../quick-setup/core/with-docker) or [Without Docker](../../quick-setup/core/without-docker))
