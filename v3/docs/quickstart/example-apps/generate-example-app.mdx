# Example App


## Overview

The fastest way to run a quick demo of **SuperTokens** is to use our example app.
You will get a quick understanding of how the authentication experience works and the overall setup of a project.

Just run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest
```

The command creates two folders under the directory name that you have provided and sets up two basic projects based on the tech stack that you have chosen.


## Project Structure

The project that was created includes two folders:
- `/frontend`: Contains the code for the frontend application and an example of how to initialize and use the frontend SDK.
- `/backend`: Contains the code for the backend application and an example of how to initialize and use the backend SDK.


## Next Steps

If you want more explanations on how to integrate **SuperTokens** with your application, please check our [**Quickstart Guide**](/docs/quickstart/introduction).

Otherwise, you can explore the other sections of the documentation that expand on the features of **SuperTokens** and 
offer you in-depth instructions on how to use them.
