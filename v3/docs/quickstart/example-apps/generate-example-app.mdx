# Example App


## Overview

In order to get a quick understanding of how SuperTokens works you can make use of our example app.

Just run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest
```

The command creates two folders under the directory name that you have provided and sets up two basic projects based on the tech stack that you have chosen.
