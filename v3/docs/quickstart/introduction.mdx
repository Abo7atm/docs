## Overview 

This quickstart guides you through how to set up a simple project that uses **SuperTokens** to authenticate users.

The tutorial will help you build a simple flow, with **Email/Password** login, that uses our **Prebuilt UI** components to render the authentication UI.

If you want to skip straight to an example application you can run our **CLI** app.
It will create a new project on your local machine based on the configuration that you will select.

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest 
```


## Before you start

Before going into the actual tutorial, let's get a clear picture of how **SuperTokens** works and some of the terms that we will use throughout the next pages.

### SuperTokens Core

The main service that provides all the functionality is called the **SuperTokens Core**. SDKs communicate over an API with this service in order to 
perform authentication related tasks.

Unlike with other providers, the **SuperTokens Frontend SDK** never talks to the **Authentication Service** directly.
All requests target your existing **Backend Service**.
With the use of our **Backend SDKs** new authentication routes get exposed which in turn will communicate with the **SuperTokens Core**.

The following diagram shows a high level overview of how your services will interact within an authentication setup that involves **SuperTokens**.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ms"
  values={[
    {label: 'Managed service', value: 'ms'},
    {label: 'Self hosted', value: 'ss'},
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="ms">
    <img src="/img/architecture/managed_service_without_dashboard.png" alt="Flowchart of architecture when using SuperTokens managed service" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ss">
    <img src="/img/architecture/self_hosted_without_dashboard.png" alt="Flowchart of architecture when self-hosting SuperTokens" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Edge Cases
- You can also host the **SuperTokens Core** yourself. In that case your backend will communicate with a service that exists inside your infrastructure.
- If you are using a backend for which we do not have an SDK, you will have to spin up an additional auth service in a language for which we do have a backend SDK (NodeJS, Python or Golang).

### Recipes

The functionalities that **SuperTokens** provides are bundled into objects that can be reffered to as **Recipes**.
Everything from *authentication methods* to *session and user management* can be included under this concept.
In the following sections, we will see how recipes get initialised and configured and how you can customise them to fit your use case.
