# Next Steps

## Overview

Now that you have completed the quickstart guide there are a few more things that you need to take care of on the road towards a production ready authentication experience.

## Configure the Core Service

If you have signed up and deployed a SuperTokens environment already, you can skip this step.
Otherwise, please follow these instructions to use the correct **SuperTokens Core** instance in your application.

The steps show you how to connect to a **SuperTokens Managed Service Environment**.
If you want to self host the core instance please check the [following guide](../pre-built-ui/setup/core/with-docker).

### 1. Sign up for a SuperTokens account

Open this [page](https://supertokens.com/auth) in order to access the account creation page.
Select the account that you want to use and wait for the action to complete.

### 2. Select the authentication method

After you have created your account, you will be prompted with a form that will ask you to specify details about your configuration.
Select which authentication method that you want to use.

### 3. Select the region where you want to deploy the core service#

SuperTokens environments can be deployed in 3 different regions: `US East (N. Virginia)`, `Europe (Ireland)`, `Asia Pacific (Singapore)`.
In order to avoid any latency issues please select a region that is closest to where your services are hosted.

### 4. Click the deploy button ðŸš€

/>

Our internal service will deploy a separate environment based on your selection.

After this process is complete, you will be directed to the dashboard page. Here you can view and edit information about your newly created environment.

The main thing that we want to focus is the **Connecting to a development instance** section.
There you can see two different values, the `connectionURI` and the `apiKey`.
You will use these values in the next step.

:::info

The initial setup flow only configures a development environment. In order to use SuperTokens in production, you will have to click the Create Production Env button.

:::

### 5. Connect the Backend SDK with SuperTokens ðŸ”Œ

Add the `connectionURI` and the `apiKey` shown on the dashboard to your code on the backend.

## Customize Your Authentication Flow

After you have connected the Backend SDK to a specific **SuperTokens Core Service**, you can go check the rest of the documentation.
There are several sections that show you how to customize the authentication experience to fit your specific needs.
Some of the most common subjects are:
