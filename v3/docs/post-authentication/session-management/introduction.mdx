  and flow.

# Introduction


SuperTokens provides session management out of the box. We prevent many session attack vectors like:
- Minimises impact of XSS attacks (by using `httpOnly` cookies for browser sessions)
- Minimises damage from access token signing key compromise.
- Minimises damage from session data theft from database.
- Reliable detecting of session hijacking.
- CSRF attacks
- Brute force attacks
- Session fixation

## Overview of session flow 
<img alt="Flowcharts showing an overview of session flow" src="/img/session_flow.png" />

- After sign in, a new session is created by issuing a refresh and access token to the frontend.
- The frontend sends the access token for each API call that requires session authentication.
- These API calls verify the access token and its expiry. If verification fails, the API throws a session expired error, else, execution continues.
- If an API throws session expired error, the frontend uses its refresh token to get a new refresh and a new access token. This is done via a special API on your backend. If a session has been revoked, this API will also throw session expired after which the user will have to login again.
- After obtaining a new set of tokens, the frontend retries the original API call, yielding the desired result.
- To revoke a session, the backend removes the refresh token and its session information from its database.

## Information about our session cookies

- `sAccessToken`: This is the session's access token which is used in each API call to verify that the user was authenticated and to get their user ID (when using cookie based authentication).

- `sRefreshToken`: This is the session's refresh token which is used to get a new access (and refresh token) when the existing access token expires (when using cookie based authentication).

- `sFrontToken`: Used to access a session's access token payload and user ID on the frontend without exposing the `sAccessToken`.

- `sAntiCsrf`: Used to prevent CSRF attacks.

- `st-last-access-token-update`: Used by the frontend to know if a session exists, and when the access token has changed.

- `st-access-token`: Used by the frontend to store the access token for header based authentication.

- `st-refresh-token`: Used by the frontend to store the refresh token for header based authentication.
