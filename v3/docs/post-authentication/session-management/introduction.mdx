# Session Management

## Overview

SuperTokens provides session management out of the box.
Sessions get created when a user signs in and maintained throught the authentication lifecycle.
In the next graphic you can see a high level overview of how session flow works.

- After sign in, a new session is created by issuing a refresh and access token to the frontend.
- The frontend sends the access token for each API call that requires session authentication.
- These API calls verify the access token and its expiry. If verification fails, the API throws a session expired error, else, execution continues.
- If an API throws session expired error, the frontend uses its refresh token to get a new refresh and a new access token. This is done via a special API on your backend. If a session has been revoked, this API will also throw session expired after which the user will have to login again.
- After obtaining a new set of tokens, the frontend retries the original API call, yielding the desired result.
- To revoke a session, the backend removes the refresh token and its session information from its database.

## Information about our session cookies

| Cookie Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `sAccessToken` | This is the session's access token which is used in each API call to verify that the user was authenticated and to get their user ID (when using cookie based authentication). |
| `sRefreshToken` | This is the session's refresh token which is used to get a new access (and refresh token) when the existing access token expires (when using cookie based authentication). |
| `sFrontToken` | Used to access a session's access token payload and user ID on the frontend without exposing the `sAccessToken`. |
| `sAntiCsrf` | Used to prevent CSRF attacks. |
| `st-last-access-token-update` | Used by the frontend to know if a session exists, and when the access token has changed. |
| `st-access-token` | Used by the frontend to store the access token for header based authentication. |
| `st-refresh-token` | Used by the frontend to store the refresh token for header based authentication. |

## Getting Started

Sessions are enabled when you include the `Session` recipe in the initial configuration. 
This step is outlined in all the guides that show you how to integrate the different authentication methods like: [Email Password](/docs/authentication/emailpassword/introduction), [Passwordless](/docs/authentication/passwordless/introduction) or [Social Login](/docs/authentication/social/introduction).

Additionally, this section includes inforation on how to work with sessions after a user has signed in.
