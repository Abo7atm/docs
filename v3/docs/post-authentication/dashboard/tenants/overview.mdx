# Tenant management overview

You can now manage [tenants, login methods and third party providers](/docs/multi-tenancy/introduction) and [Multi factor authentication](/docs/additional-verification/mfa/introduction) of your app from the tenant management dashboard.

Once the dashboard recipe is initialised, the tenant management should be available without requiring any additional steps.

:::info Caution

Currently, this is only available with our Node and Python SDKs.

## Creating a new tenant

Clicking on `Add Tenant` will prompt you to enter the tenant id. Once the tenant id is entered, click on `Create Now` to create the tenant. You will then be taken to the Tenant Details page where you can further manage the newly created tenant.
