# Passwordless login

You can see the default UI when you visit the `websiteBasePath` (`/auth` by default) on your website. The UI offers different modes:
- Magic link based
- OTP based
- Magic link and OTP based

You can send magic link / OTP using:
- Email
- SMS / WhatsApp / Messenger etc.
- Email and SMS / WhatsApp / Messenger etc.

## Email or phone input UI

If the `contactMethod` is `EMAIL_OR_PHONE`, the user will see the following UI when they visit the login page.

If the user decides to use their phone number and enters a valid phone number with their country code extension, they will go to the next step. Otherwise they will be shown an error message asking them to also enter their country code. The UI will also change to showing a dropdown containing a list of all countries (equal to the "Only phone input UI" shown below).

## Only email input UI
If the `contactMethod` is `EMAIL`, the user will see the following UI when they visit the login page.

<img src="/img/passwordless-email.png" alt="Email only passwordless login" />

## Only phone input UI
If the `contactMethod` is `PHONE`, the user will see the following UI when they visit the login page.

<img src="/img/passwordless-phone.png" alt="Phone only passwordless login" />

## Invalid email or phone input UI
If the user enters an invalid phone or email, they will see the following message

<img src="/img/passwordless-invalid-phone-email.png" alt="Invalid phone or email" />

## Magic link sent screen

If the value of `flowType` on the backend is `MAGIC_LINK`, then after the user has submitted their phone or email, they will see the following UI.

<img src="/img/magic-link-sent.png" alt="Magic link sent UI" />

As you can see, a timer makes the user wait for a certain time period (15 seconds by default) before they can resend the SMS / email. A button below the input allows them to change the email / SMS (the text on the button changes based on if the user entered an email or phone number).

## Magic link clicked screens

The magic link is of the format: `${websiteDomain}/${websiteBasePath}/verify?tenantId=...&preAuthSessionId=<token1>#<token2>`.

### On same device
When the user clicks the magic link and opens it on the same device on which they initiated the flow, they will see the following UI before being redirected to the sign in success page (`/` by default). On this screen, SuperTokens will automatically extract the two tokens from the magic link URL and try and consume them on the backend in order to log the user in.

### On different device

If the user opens the magic link on a different device, we ask them to take an action before consuming tokens from the link. This is to prevent email clients from automatically consuming the tokens if they crawl links in the email.

<img src="/img/magic-link-clicked-different-device.png" alt="Magic link consumed on different device" />

### Invalid / expired magic link UI

If the user clicks on an invalid magic link or if the token in the magic link has expired, they will see the login screen with the following message

<img src="/img/passwordless-magic-link-expired.png" alt="Invalid magic link" />

## Enter OTP screen

If login via OTP is enabled, then the user will see this screen immediately after their enter their phone number / email.

<img src="/img/enter-otp-screen.png" alt="Enter OTP screen" />

As you can see, a timer makes the user wait for a certain time period (15 seconds by default) before they can resend the SMS / email. A button below the input allows them to change the email / SMS (the text on the button changes based on if the user entered an email or phone number).

### Invalid OTP

If the user enters an incorrect OTP, this is what they see.

<img src="/img/enter-otp-invalid.png" alt="Invalid OTP" />

Entering an incorrect OTP too many times results in the user being navigated back to the login screen with the following message.

<img src="/img/passwordless-too-many-otp-tries.png" alt="Entered invalid OTP too many times" />

### Logging in via OTP and Magic link simultaneously 

An edge case occurs wherein the end user gets both an OTP and a magic link, and whilst viewing the enter OTP screen, they also click on the magic link separately. The magic link click will open a new tab and will consume the link to log the user in. The enter OTP screen will continue to show the enter OTP UI until the user refreshes the page, after which, it will redirect to the post login screen.

## Default email and SMS template

You can find the email and SMS templates along with their UI [in one of our GitHub repositories](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates).

You can change the content of the email & SMSs and / or how they are sent. For more information on this, please see the links at the end of this page.

## General errors

If there are network related errors, or the backend sends a status code >= 300, then we show the following UI. This UI is also shown if there is a similar error in the callback page.

<img src="/img/passwordless-passwordless-general-error.png" alt="Login screen general error" />

<img src="/img/enter-otp-error.png" alt="Enter OTP screen general error" />

<img src="/img/magic-link-sent-error.png" alt="Magic link sent screen general error" />

The error below is shown if something went wrong after the user clicks on the magic link. Reloading the page should result in a reattempt
