# Social login

You can see the default UI when you visit the `websiteBasePath` (`/auth` by default) on your website.

## Default social login button UI

## Callback page UI
When the user is navigated back to your application from the third party provider, they will see the following UI. On this screen, SuperTokens will take the authorisation code from the URL (sent by the provider) and send it to the backend. The backend will exchange that for the user's access token and information.

## Sign in / up unsuccessful UI

SuperTokens requires that the thirdparty provider gives an email for the user. If that's not the case for a certain provider, the user will see the following UI.

<img src="/img/thirdparty-no-email.png" alt="No email UI for provider" />

## General error UI

If there are network related errors, or the backend sends a status code >= 300, then we show the following UI. This UI is also shown if there is a similar error in the callback page.
