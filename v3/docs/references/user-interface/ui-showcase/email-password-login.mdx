  handling.

# Email password login

You can see the default UI when you visit the `websiteBasePath` (`/auth` by default) on your website. The form is split into a sign in and a sign up form, and by default, we show the sign in form.

## Default sign in form

## Default sign up form

<img src="/img/emailpassword-sign-up.png" alt="Sign up form UI for email password login" />

## Field validation error UI

The sign up form checks if the email is unique and if not, shows an error to the user saying that the email already exists. Likewise, if any of the form field's validation fails, the user will see an error like below.

<img src="/img/emailpassword-field-validation-error.png" alt="Sign up form field error UI" />


## Incorrect email / password UI
In the sign in form, if the user enters an email that doesn't exist, or is an incorrect email & password combination, they will see the following error.

## General error UI
If there are network related errors, or the backend sends a status code >= 300, then we show the following UI.
