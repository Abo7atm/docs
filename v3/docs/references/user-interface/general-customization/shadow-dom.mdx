<UIType.PrebuiltUIContent>

We use [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to prevent CSS clashes between your CSS and the ones we provide. This guarantees that all our UI will render as expected.

However, this has a few problems:
- You cannot override our CSS using your CSS (though you can [use JS to do that](./changing-style)).
- Password managers may not work for your end user.

If you want to disable use of shadow dom, you can do so like:

<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs>
<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    useShadowDom: false,
    recipeList: [/* ... */]
});
```
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem>

<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem value="angular">

```tsx
// this goes in the auth route config of your frontend app (once the pre built UI script has been loaded)
import {init as supertokensUIInit} from "supertokens-auth-react-script";

supertokensUIInit({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    useShadowDom: false,
    recipeList: [/* ... */]
});
```
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem>
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs>

:::caution
If disabled, please be sure to check that our components render correctly - because your CSS might affect our components' UI (the other way around won't happen).
