### UI Customization

- use scss modules. that's what docusaurus uses. that's what we use. prevent any conflicts.
- any custom css class name that's added over an ejected component should have the Custom suffix.
- don't add extra inline colors, sizes, etc. if they can be adjusted from the variables.
