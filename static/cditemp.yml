go through each operation in this file and add the following things:
- a summary property that describes in max 6 words the action performed (Get Users, Add TOTP device, etc). Use sentence case for this 
- add descriptions to properties and schemas that do not have them.  
- If a request body has multiple schema options (schema definition starts with "oneOf") add a title and a definition (if not set) to each schema that is part of the "oneOf" property  
- add summary information to each response type (6 words max, sentence case) 
- If a response body has multiple schema options (schema definition starts with "oneOf") add a title and a definition (if not set) to each schema that is part of the "oneOf" property  

Do not create/add any new endpoints. Just edit the current information
