# Frontend Driver Interface


## Overview

This is the API exposed by the **SuperTokens Backend SDKs**.
It is meant to be consumed only by your frontend applications.

:::info no-title
Interact directly with this API only if you are building your own custom frontend.
In most cases, the available frontend SDKs will do the job for you.

### URL Structure

All the endpoints are prefixed with `{apiBasePath}`.
This is the equivalent of the property with the same name that you set during [backend SDK initialization](/docs/quickstart/backend-setup#2-initialize-the-sdk).

Tenant specific actions include a `{tenantId}` parameter. If not set, the default tenant will be used.

Given the following endpoint: `/{apiBasePath}/{tenantId}/signinup`, and the `apiBasePath` set to `auth`
- You can call it without the actual parameter, using `/auth/signinup` in your action. 
- You can set the values to target a specific tenant: `/auth/myTenant/signinup`.

### Versioning

At the moment, the documentation pages only show the latest version of the API.
If you want to check an older release, please access the [swaggerhub page](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/supertokens/FDI)

To know which version you should see:
1. Go to the GitHub page of the backend or frontend SDK you are using
2. Switch to the branch that matches the version of the SDK
3. Open the file called `frontendDriverInterfaceSupported.json`
4. In there, you see an array of `X.Y` values, pick the latest one, and see the API spec for that.


## Authentication

Some of the API endpoints require authorization.
There are two main ways to authenticate:
1. Through cookies.
2. Through authentication headers.
