   This API is deprecated. Please use the v2 version of this API. In the v2 version of the API, the login methods are no longer enabled using the `emailPasswordEnabled`, `thirdPartyEnabled` and `passwordlessEnabled` inputs. Instead, they are enabled using factorIds (such as emailpassword, otp-email, etc) specified in the `firstFactors` and `requiredSecondaryFactors` inputs. Please refer [Multitenancy Docs](https://supertokens.com/docs/multitenancy/new-tenant) to know the list of factorIds available.
   
   Note: This deprecated API still returns `emailPasswordEnabled`, `thirdPartyEnabled` and `passwordlessEnabled` values for backward compatibility, and it's values are derived from the `firstFactors` and `requiredSecondaryFactors` configured for the tenant. The detailed computation of the values as per CDI version is described here: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/issues/979#issuecomment-2099971371
