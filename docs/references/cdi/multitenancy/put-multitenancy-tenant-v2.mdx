For eg. if this is set to `['otp-phone', 'totp']`, the users of the tenant will be required to complete either phone OTP or TOTP post the first factor login.

   If updating an existing tenant,
   1. core will keep the existing state of login methods and only update the ones that are specified in the request body.
   2. Core config will be merged into existing config. To delete a key in the config, use a null value
   
   The request must originate from public tenant, and the new tenant will use connectionUriDomain and app from which the request originates.
   
   Note: Updation of core config is not allowed for the default connectionUriDomain, public app and tenant. In order to update config for the default connectionUriDomain, public app and tenant, you must edit the config.yaml or the docker env directly.
