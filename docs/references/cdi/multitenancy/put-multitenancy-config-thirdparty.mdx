   Creates or updates ThirdParty Provider Config for a tenant.
   
   If `skipValidation` is set to true, the config will be saved without any validation.
   
   If the config already exists for the given `tenantId` and `thirdPartyId`, the config in the core will be completely replaced with the config provided in the request body.
   
   **Validations done by the core:**
   
   `thirdPartyId` and `name` are required
   
   Common to all providers:
   - `clients` list:
   - can be undefined or empty
   - if contains 1 element, clientType can be empty or undefined
   - if contains more than 1 element, clientType must be defined and unique
   - for each element in `clients`:
   - `clientId` must not be empty
   
   Built-in provider's specific validation is invoked if the `thirdPartyId` starts with the provider's id
   
   Apple (id: apple):
   - `clients`
   - if it contains elements, each of them are validated as follows:
   - `clientSecret` must be empty or undefined
   - `additionalConfig` should contain the following keys:
   - `keyId` must be a non empty string
   - `teamId` must be a non empty string
   - `privateKey` must be a non empty string
   
   Google Workspaces (id: google-workspaces):
   - `clients`
   - if it contains elements, each of them are validated as follows:
   - `additionalConfig` may contain the key `hd`
   - `hd` is optional
   - if specified, it must be either `"*"`, or a valid domain
   
   Boxy SAML (id: boxy-saml):
   - `clients`
   - `additionalConfig` in the each element must contain `boxyURL` and must be non-empty string
